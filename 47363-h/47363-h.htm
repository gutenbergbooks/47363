<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_SIXTH_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SIXTH_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fifth Edition of our book was exhausted before war was declared,
and not until peace was declared was it thought by the publishers advisable
to issue this Sixth Edition, which has been revised and brought
up to date, and contains new material and new illustrations. All the
while we have been collecting and verifying documents, and all the
while we have received suggestions, facts, and inquiries. The book
has been published in French, but for the war it would have been long
since translated into other languages. During these years of needless,
senseless, useless horrors, the name and fame of Whistler have steadily
grown. His works have served as propaganda&mdash;what a comment!&mdash;even
the portrait of his mother has been used as a poster by the British,
and his own portrait has obtained the glory of appearing as a tribute
to the power of advertising. All the while, endless stories, most of them
garbled from this book, when not invented, have gone from end to end of
the world. Exhibitions of his paintings and prints and of documents
relating to him have been held. Galleries and private collectors have
acquired what little of his work was left to acquire. Even the National
Gallery of Great Britain has accepted three of his pictures from the late
Arthur Studd though Whistler had distinctly said that he did not wish
to be represented in any English gallery. Dealers have found in his art
inexhaustible attraction and asset for shows. Mr. Freer's collection
in the National Museum, Washington, is about to open. Our collection
is being installed in the Library of Congress, also in Washington&mdash;though
it was damaged by unpardonable and undiscoverable carelessness
in transit, caused by this cursed war. Washington must
soon be visited to see Whistler as Madrid is to see Velasquez. All the
while, too, the financial appreciation of Whistler&mdash;the standard by
which art and everything is judged to-day&mdash;has vastly increased, the
<i>Mrs. Leyland</i> and <i>Lady Meux</i> selling for more hundreds of thousands
than he asked hundreds of dollars for. His etchings and lithographs
have so improved in value in the collector's estimation that persons
whom Whistler did everything to help in forming their collections have
considered them too valuable to keep, and so have parted with them at
an enormous rise over even his "posthumous prices." What would he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_0vi" id="Page_0vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
have thought of all this, he who so carefully selected the prints "kindly
lent their owners?"</p>

<p>Whistler, fortunately, has escaped the indignity of commercial
popularity, but he has come into his own; his name and his fame are
world-wide, he is with the immortals; we said so in the beginning, and
time has proved us right. There have been no books of importance
issued about him of late years, though contemporary authors who
spurned him during his life now claim his acquaintance and add a
paragraph or a page, mostly from our book, as a bait to sell their own.
Miss Philip delays, or awaits the lapse of twenty years, before issuing
the letters. When she does print them&mdash;if properly edited&mdash;they will
be a great addition to the knowledge of Whistler. Mr. Freer announces
also a life which is to supersede or expose us, or Whistler. Still they
tarry, but anything they may issue will add to the success and, we
trust, the completeness of the authorized <i>Life of Whistler</i>. We
should be grateful for any further information, suggestions, or corrections
to that end from any of our readers.</p>

<p>We wish to thank, for the permission to reproduce paintings and
drawings, to consult letters and documents, Mrs. A. J. Cassatt, Mr.

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Pennell's</span> authorised <i>Life of James McNeill Whistler</i>
appeared in two volumes in October 1908, and has had to be reprinted
in that form three times since then. Its sale even in that comparatively
expensive form has been an unexpectedly large one, proving without
doubt that interest in Whistler's life is alive and growing. During
the three years since its first publication much new material has
come into the hands of the authors, and a complete revision of the
book has therefore become necessary. The present volume is, to all
intents and purposes, a new one. Many of the older illustrations in
the earlier editions have been superseded by new ones, a number of
which are reproduced for the first time.</p>

<p>For the new material included in this edition the authors and the
publisher are indebted to friends and numerous sympathetic correspondents,
and they wish to express their indebtedness especially to

<h2>CHAPTER I: THE WHISTLER FAMILY.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN THIRTY-FOUR TO EIGHTEEN FORTY-THREE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">James Abbott McNeill Whistler</span> was born on July 10, 1834, at
Lowell, Massachusetts, in the United States of America.</p>

<p>Whistler, in the witness-box during the suit he brought against
Ruskin in 1878, gave St. Petersburg as his birthplace&mdash;or the reporters
did&mdash;and he never denied it. Baltimore was given by M. Théodore
Duret in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> (April 1881), and M. Duret's
mistake, since corrected by him, has been many times repeated.
The late Mrs. Livermore, who knew Whistler as a child at Lowell,
asked him why he did not contradict this. His answer was: "If any
one likes to think I was born in Baltimore, why should I deny it?
It is of no consequence to me!" On entering West Point he stated
that Massachusetts was his place of birth. But, as a rule, he met
any one indiscreet enough to question him on the subject as he did
the American who came up to him one evening in the Carlton Hotel,
London, and by way of introduction said, "You know, Mr. Whistler,
we were both born at Lowell, and at very much the same time. There
is only the difference of a year&mdash;you are sixty-seven and I am sixty-eight."
"And I told him," said Whistler, from whom we had
the story the next day, "'Very charming! And so you are
sixty-eight and were born at Lowell! Most interesting, no doubt,
and as you please! But I shall be born when and where I want,
and I do not choose to be born at Lowell, and I refuse to be sixty-seven!'"</p>

<p>Whistler was christened at St. Anne's Church, Lowell, November 9,
1834. "Baptized, James Abbott, infant son of George Washington
and Anna Mathilda Whistler: Sponsors, the parents. Signed,
T. Edson"; so it is recorded in the church register. He was named
after James Abbott, of Detroit, who had married his father's elder
sister, Sarah Whistler. McNeill (his mother's name) was added
shortly after he entered West Point. Abbott he always kept for
legal and official documents. But, eventually, he dropped it for
other purposes, "J. A. M." pleasing him no better than "J. A. W.,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and he signed himself "James McNeill Whistler" or "J. M. N.
Whistler."</p>

<p>The Rev. Rose Fuller Whistler, in his <i>Annals of an English Family</i>
(1887), says that John le Wistler de Westhannye (1272-1307) was the
founder of the family. Most of the Whistlers lived in Goring,
Whitchurch, or Oxford, and are buried in many a church and churchyard
of the Thames Valley. Brasses and tablets to the memory of
several are in the church of St. Mary at Goring: one to "Hugh
Whistler, the son of Master John Whistler of Goring, who departed
this life the 17 Day of Januarie Anno Dominie 1675 being aged 216
years"&mdash;an amazing statement, but there it is in the parish church
durable as brass can make it, and it would have delighted Whistler.
The solemn antiquary, however, has decided that the 21 is only a badly
cut 4. This remarkable ancestor figures as a family ghost at Gatehampton,
where he is said to have been buried with his money, and
there he still walks, guarding the treasure he lived so many years to
gather. The position of the Whistlers entitled them to a coat of
arms, described in the Harleian MSS., No. 1556, and thus in <i>Gwillim's
Heraldry</i>: "Gules, five mascles, in bend between two Talbots passant
argent"; and the motto "Forward."</p>

<p>The men were mostly soldiers and parsons. A few made names
for themselves. The shield of Gabriel Whistler, of Combe, Sussex,
is one of six in King's College Chapel, Cambridge. Anthony Whistler,
poet, friend of Shenstone, belonged to the Whitchurch family. Dr.
Daniel Whistler (1619-1684), of the Essex branch, was a Fellow of
Merton, an original Fellow of the Royal Society, a member and afterwards
President of the College of Physicians, friend of Evelyn and
Pepys. Evelyn often met him in "select companie" at supper,
and once "Din'd at Dr. Whistler's at the Physicians Colledge," and
found him not only learned but "the most facetious man in nature,"
the legitimate ancestor of Whistler. Pepys, who also dined and
supped with him many times, pronounced him "good company and
a very ingenious man." He fell under a cloud with the officials of
the College of Physicians, and his portrait has been consigned to a
back stairway of the Hall in Pall Mall. In the seventeenth century
Ralph Whistler, of the Salters' Company, London, was one of the
colonisers of Ulster, and Francis Whistler was a settler of Virginia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
When Whistler saw the name "Francis Whistler, Gentleman," in
the <i>Genesis of the United States</i>, he said to us, "There is an ancestor,
with the hall-mark F.F.V. [First Families of Virginia], who tickles
my American snobbery, and washes out the taint of Lowell."</p>

<p>The American Whistlers are descended from John Whistler of the
Irish branch. In his youth he ran away and enlisted. Sir Kensington
Whistler, an English cousin, was an officer in the same regiment, and
objected to having a relative in the ranks. John Whistler, therefore,
was transferred to another regiment starting for the American colonies.
He arrived in time to surrender at Saratoga with Burgoyne. He went
back to England, received his discharge, eloped with Anna, daughter
of Sir Edward Bishop or Bischopp, and, returning to America, settled
at Hagerstown, Maryland. He again enlisted, this time in the United
States army. He rose to the brevet rank of major and served in the
war of 1812 against Great Britain. He was stationed at Fort Dearborn,
which he helped to build, and Fort Wayne. According to
Mr. A. J. Eddy (<i>Recollections and Impressions of Whistler</i>), Whistler
once said to a visitor from Chicago:</p>

<p>"Chicago, dear me, what a wonderful place! I really ought to
visit it some day; for, you know, my grandfather founded the city,
and my uncle was the last commander of Fort Dearborn!"</p>

<p>In 1815, upon the reduction of the army, Major John Whistler
was retired. He died in 1817, at Bellefontaine, Missouri. Of his
fifteen children, three sons are remembered as soldiers, and three
daughters married army officers. George Washington, the most distinguished
son, was the father of James Abbott McNeill Whistler.</p>

<p>George Washington Whistler was born on May 19, 1800, at Fort
Wayne. He was educated mostly at Newport, Kentucky; and from
Kentucky, when a little over fourteen, he received his appointment
to the Military Academy, West Point, where he is remembered for
his gaiety. Mr. George L. Vose, his biographer, and others tell stories
that might have been told of his son. One is of some breach of discipline,
for which he was made to bestride a gun on the campus. As
he sat there he saw, coming towards him, the Miss Swift he was before
long to marry. Out came his handkerchief, and, leaning over
the gun, he set to work cleaning it so carefully that he was "honoured,
not disgraced," in her eyes. He was number one in drawing, and

his playing on the flute won him the nickname "Pipes." He graduated
on July 1, 1819. He was appointed second lieutenant in the First
Artillery, and, in 1829, first lieutenant in the Second Artillery. He
served on topographical duty, and for a few months he was assistant
professor at the Academy. There was not much fighting for American
officers of his generation. But railroads were being built, and so
few were the civil engineers that West Point graduates were allowed
by Government to work for private corporations, and he was employed
on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Baltimore and Susquehanna,
and the Paterson and Hudson River. For the Baltimore and
Ohio he went to England in 1828 to examine the railway system.
He was building the line from Stonington to Providence, when, in
1833, he resigned from the army with the rank of major, to carry on
his profession as a civil engineer.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Major Whistler had married twice. His first
wife was Mary Swift, daughter of Dr. Foster Swift, of the United
States army. She left three children: George, who became a well
known civil engineer; Joseph, who died in youth; and Deborah,
Lady Haden. His second wife was Anna Mathilda McNeill, daughter
of Dr. Charles Donald McNeill, of Wilmington, North Carolina, and
sister of William Gibbs McNeill, a West Point classmate and an associate
in Major Whistler's engineering work. The McNeills were
descended from the McNeills of Skye. Their chief, Donald, emigrated
with sixty of his clan to North Carolina in 1746, and bought land on
Cape Fear River. Charles Donald McNeill was his grandson and was
twice married; his second wife, Martha Kingsley, was the mother
of Anna Mathilda McNeill, who became Mrs. George Washington
Whistler. The McNeills were related by marriage to the Fairfaxes
and other Virginia families, and Whistler, on his mother's side, was
the Southerner he loved to call himself.</p>

<p>In 1834 Major Whistler accepted the post of engineer of locks and
canals at Lowell, and to this town he brought his family. There, in
the Paul Moody House on Worthen Street, James McNeill Whistler
was born, and the house is now a Whistler Memorial Museum. Two
years later the second son, William Gibbs McNeill, was born. In
1837 Major Whistler moved to Stonington, Connecticut, and Miss
Emma W. Palmer and Mrs. Dr. Stanton, his wife's nieces, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
remember his "pleasant house on Main Street." It is said that he had a
chaise fitted with car wheels in which he and his family drove every
Sunday on the tracks to church at Westerly; also that a locomotive
named Whistler was in use on the road until recently. He was consulted
in regard to many new lines, among them the Western Railroad
of Massachusetts, for which he was consulting engineer from 1836 to
1840. In 1840 he was made chief engineer, and he removed to Springfield,
Massachusetts, where he lived in the Ethan Chapin Homestead
on Chestnut Street, north of Edward Street. A third son, Kirk Booth,
born at Stonington in 1838, died at Springfield in 1842, and here a
fourth son, Charles Donald, was born in 1841.</p>

<p>In 1842 Nicholas I. of Russia sent a commission, under Colonel
Melnikoff, round Europe and America to find the best method and
the best man to build a railroad from St. Petersburg to Moscow, and
they chose the American, George Washington Whistler. The honour
was great and the salary large, 12,000 dollars a year. He accepted,
and started for Russia in Midsummer 1842, leaving his family at
Stonington.</p>

<p>The life of a child, for the first nine years or so, is not of much interest
to any save his parents. An idea can be formed of Whistler's
early training. His father was a West Point man, with all that is fine
in the West Point tradition. Mrs. Whistler, described as "one of
the saints upon earth," was as strict as a Puritan. Dr. Whistler&mdash;Willie&mdash;often
told his wife of the dread with which he and Jimmie
looked forward to Saturday afternoon, with its overhauling of clothes,
emptying of pockets, washing of heads, putting away of toys, and
preparation for Sunday, when the Bible was the only book they read.
Of the facts of his childhood there are few to record. Mrs. Livermore
remembered his baby beauty, so great that her father used to
say "it was enough to make Sir Joshua Reynolds come out of his
grave and paint Jemmie asleep." In his younger years he was called
Jimmie, Jemmie, Jamie, James, and Jim, and we use these names
as we have found them in the letters written to us and the books
quoted. Mrs. Livermore dwelt on the child's beautiful hands, "which
belong to so many of the Whistlers." When she returned to Lowell
in 1836 from the Manor School at York, England, Mrs. Whistler's son,
Willie, had just been born:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as Mrs. Whistler was strong enough, she sent for me to
go and see her boy, and I did see her and her baby in bed! And
then I asked, 'Where is Jemmie, of whom I have heard so much?'
She replied, 'He was in the room a short time since, and I think he
must be here still.' So I went softly about the room till I saw a very
small form prostrate and at full length on the shelf under the dressing-table,
and I took hold of an arm and a leg and placed him on my knee,
and then said, 'What were you doing, dear, under the table?' 'I'se
drawrin',' and in one very beautiful little hand he held the paper, in
the other the pencil."</p>

<p>The pencil drawings which we have seen, owned by Mrs. Livermore,
are curiously firm and strong for a child of four.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II: IN RUSSIA.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FORTY-THREE
TO EIGHTEEN FORTY-NINE.</h2>
<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1843, when Whistler was nine years old, Major Whistler sent for his
wife and children. Mrs. Whistler sailed from Boston in the <i>Arcadia</i>,
August 12, 1843, taking with her Deborah and the three boys, James,
William, and Charles. George Whistler, Major Whistler's eldest son,
and her "good maid Mary" went with them. The story of their
journey and their life in Russia is recorded in Mrs. Whistler's journal.</p>

<p>They arrived at Liverpool on the 29th of the same month. Mrs.
Whistler's two half-sisters, Mrs. William Winstanley and Miss Alicia
McNeill, lived at Preston, and there they stayed a fortnight. Then,
after a few days in London, they sailed for Hamburg.</p>

<p>There was no railroad from Hamburg, so they drove by carriage
to Lübeck, by stage to Travemünde, where they took the steamer
<i>Alexandra</i> for St. Petersburg, and George Whistler left them. Between
Travemünde and Cronstadt, Charles, the youngest child, fell ill
of seasickness and died within a day. There was just time to bury
him at Cronstadt&mdash;temporarily; he was afterwards buried at Stonington&mdash;and
his death saddened the meeting between Major Whistler
and his wife and children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whistler objected to hotels and to boarding, and a house
was found in the Galernaya. She did her best to make it not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a comfortable, but an American home, for Major Whistler's attachment
to his native land, she said, was so strong as to be almost a religious
sentiment. Their food was American, American holidays were kept
in American fashion. Many of their friends were Americans. Major
Whistler was nominally consulting engineer to Colonel Melnikoff, but
actually in charge of the construction and equipment of the line, and
as the material was supplied by the firm of Winans of Baltimore,
Mr. Winans and his partners, Messrs. Harrison and Eastwick, of
Philadelphia, were in Russia with their families.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whistler's strictness did not mean opposition to pleasure.
Yet at times she became afraid that her boys were not "keeping to
the straight and narrow way." There were evenings of illuminations
that put off bedtime; there were afternoons of skating and coasting;
Christmas gaieties, with Christmas dinners of roast turkey and pumpkin
pie; visits to American friends; parties at home, when the two
boys "behaved like gentlemen, and their father commended them
upon it"; there were presents of guns from the father, returning
from long absences on the road; there were dancing lessons, which
Jemmie would have done anything rather than miss.</p>

<p>Whistler as a boy was exactly what those who knew him as a man
would expect; gay and bright, absorbed in his work when that work
was art, brave and fearless, selfish if selfishness is another name for
ambition, considerate and kindly, above all to his mother. The boy,
like the man, was delightful to those who understood him; "startling,"
"alarming," to those who did not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whistler's journal soon becomes extremely interesting:</p>

<p><i>March 29</i> (1844). "I must not omit recording our visiting the
Gastinnoi to-day in anticipation of Palm Sunday. Our two boys
were most excited, Jemmie's animation roused the wonder of many,
for even in crowds here such decorum and gravity prevails that it must
be surprising when there is any ebullition of joy."</p>

<p><i>April 22</i> (1844). "Jemmie is confined to his bed with a mustard
plaster on his throat; he has been very poorly since the thawing
season commenced, soon becoming overheated, takes cold; when he
complained of pain first in his shoulder, then in his side, my fears of
a return of last year's attack made me tremble, and when I gaze upon
his pale face sleeping, contrasted to Willie's round cheeks, my heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
is full; our dear James said to me the other day, so touchingly, 'Oh,
I am sorry the Emperor ever asked father to come to Russia, but if I
had the boys here, I should not feel so impatient to get back to Stonington,'
yet I cannot think the climate here affects his health; Willie
never was as stout in his native land, and James looks better than
when we brought him here. At eight o'clock I am often at my reading
or sewing without a candle, and I cannot persuade James to put up
his drawing and go to bed while it is light."</p>

<p>The journal explains that Whistler as a boy suffered from severe
rheumatic attacks that added to the weakness of his heart, the eventual
cause of his death. Major and Mrs. Whistler rented a country-house
on the Peterhoff Road in the spring of 1844. There is an account of
a day at Tsarskoé Seló, when Colonel Todd, American Minister to
Russia, showed them the Palace:</p>

<p><i>May 6</i> (1844). "Rode to the station, and took the cars upon the
only railroad in Russia, which took us the twenty versts to the pretty
town. It would be ungenerous in me to remark how inferior the
railroad, cars, &amp;c., seemed to us Americans. The boys were delighted
with it all. Jemmie wished he could stay to examine the fine pictures
and know who painted them, but as I returned through the grounds
I asked him if he should wish to be a grand duke and own it all for
playgrounds: he decided there could be no freedom with a footman
at his heels."</p>

<p><i>July 1</i> (1844). "... I went with Willie to do some shopping
in the Nevski. He is rather less excitable than Jemmie, and therefore
more tractable. They each can make their wants known in Russ.,
but I prefer this gentlest of my dear boys to go with me. We had
hardly reached home when a tremendous shower came up, and Jemmie
and a friend, who had been out in a boat on a canal at the end of our
avenue, got well drenched. Just as we were seated at tea, a carriage
drove up and Mr. Miller entered, introducing Sir William Allen, the
great Scotch artist, of whom we have heard lately, who has come
to St. Petersburg to revive on canvas some of the most striking events
from the life of Peter the Great. They had been to the monastery
to listen to the chanting at vespers in the Greek chapel. Mr. Miller
congratulated his companion on being in the nick of time for our
excellent home-made bread and fresh butter, but, above all, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
refreshment of a good cup of tea. His chat then turned upon the subject
of Sir William Allen's painting of Peter the Great teaching the
mujiks to make ships. This made Jemmie's eyes express so much
interest that his love for art was discovered, and Sir William must
needs see his attempts. When my boys had said good night, the
great artist remarked to me, 'Your little boy has uncommon genius,
but do not urge him beyond his inclination.' I told him his gift had
only been cultivated as an amusement, and that I was obliged to
interfere, or his application would confine him more than we approved."</p>

<p>Of these attempts there remain few examples. One is the portrait
of his aunt Alicia McNeill, who visited them in Russia in 1844, sent
to Mrs. Palmer at Stonington, with the inscription: "James to Aunt
Kate." In a letter to Mrs. Livermore, written in French, when he
was ten or eleven, "he enclosed some pretty pen-and-ink drawings,
each on a separate bit of paper, and each surrounded by a frame of his
own designing." He told us he could remember wonderful things
he had done during the years in Russia. Once, he said, when on a
holiday in London with his father, he was not well, and was given a
hot foot-bath, and he could never forget how he sat looking at his foot,
and then got paper and colours and set to work to make a study of it,
"and in Russia," he added, "I was always doing that sort of thing."</p>

<p><i>July 4</i> (1844). "I have given my boys holiday to celebrate the
Independence of their country.... This morning Jemmie began
relating anecdotes from the life of Charles XII. of Sweden, and rather
upbraided me that I could not let him do as that monarch had done
at seven years old&mdash;manage a horse! I should have been at a loss
how to afford my boys a holiday, with a military parade to-day, but
there was an encampment of cadets, about two estates off, and they
went with Colonel T.'s sons to see them."</p>

<p><i>July 10</i> (1844). "A poem selected by my darling Jamie and put
under my plate at the breakfast-table, as a surprise on his tenth birthday.
I shall copy it, that he may be reminded of his happy childhood
when perhaps his grateful mother is not with him."</p>

<p><i>August 20</i> (1844). "... Jemmie is writing a note to his Swedish
tutor on his birthday. Jemmie loves him sincerely and gratefully.
I suppose his partiality to this Swede makes him espouse his country's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
cause and admire the qualities of Charles XII. so greatly to the prejudice
of Peter the Great. He has been quite enthusiastic while reading
the life of this King of Sweden, this summer, and too willing to excuse
his errors."</p>

<p><i>August 23</i> (1844). "I wish I could describe the gardens at Peterhoff
where we were invited to drive to-day. The fountains are, perhaps,
the finest in the world. The water descends in sheets over steps, all
the heathen deities presiding. Jemmie was delighted with the figure
of Samson tearing open the jaws of the lion, from which ascends a
<i>jet d'eau</i> one hundred feet.... There are some fine pictures, but
Peter's own paintings of the feathered race ought to be most highly
prized, though our Jemmie was so saucy as to laugh at them."</p>

<p><i>August 28</i> (1844). "I avail myself of Col. Todd's invitation
to visit Tsarskoé Seló to-day with Aunt Alicia, Deborah, and the
two dear boys, who are always so delighted at these little excursions....
My little Jemmie's heart was made sad by discovering swords
which had been taken in the battle between Peter and Charles XII.,
for he knew, from their rich hilts set in pearls and precious stones,
that they must have belonged to noble Swedes. 'Oh!' he exclaimed,
'I'd rather have one of these than all the other things in the armoury!
How beautiful they are!'... I was somewhat annoyed that Col.
Todd had deemed it necessary to have a dinner party for us.</p>

<p>"... The colonel proposed the Emperor's health in champagne,
which not even the Russian general, who declined wine, could refuse,
and even I put my glass to my lips, which so encouraged my little
boys that they presented their glasses to be filled, and, forgetting at
their little side-table the guests at ours, called out aloud, <i>'Santé à
l'Empereur!'</i> The captain clapped his hands with delight, and afterwards
addressed them in French. All at the table laughed and called
the boys '<i>Bons sujets</i>.'"</p>

<p>They were at St. Petersburg again in September, preparing their
Christmas gifts for America. Whistler, sending one to his cousin
Amos Palmer, wrote in an outburst of patriotism that "the English
were going to America to be licked by the Yankees": it was at the
time of the disagreement over Oregon Territory. In another letter he
gives the Fourth of July as his birthday.</p>

<p><i>Ash Wednesday</i> (1845). "I avail myself of this Lenten season
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to have my boys every morning before breakfast recite a verse from
the Psalms, and I, who wish to encourage them, am ready with my
response. How very thankful I shall be when the weather moderates
so that Jemmie's long imprisonment may end, and Willie have his dear
brother with him in the skating grounds and ice-hills. Here comes
my good boy Jemmie now, with his history in hand to read to me,
as he does every afternoon, as we fear they may lose their own language
in other tongues, and thus I gain a half-hour's enjoyment by hearing
them read daily."</p>

<p><i>April 5</i> (1845). "Our boys have left the breakfast table before
eight o'clock to trundle their new hoops on the Quai with their governess,
and have brought home such bright red cheeks and buoyant spirits to
enter the schoolroom with and to gladden my eyes. Jemmie began
his course of drawing lessons at the Academy of Fine Arts just on the
opposite side of the Neva, exactly fronting my bedroom window. He
is entered at the second room. There are two higher, and he fears he
shall not reach them, because the officer who is still to continue his
private lesson at home is a pupil himself in the highest, and Jemmie
looks up to him with all the reverence an artist merits. He seems
greatly to enjoy going to his class, and yesterday had to go by the
bridge on account of the ice, and felt very important when he told
me he had to give the Isvóshtclók fifteen copecks silver instead of
ten."</p>

<p>In the archives of the Imperial Academy of Science there is a
"List of Scholars of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts," and in
this and the "Class Journal of the Inspector" for 1845 James Whistler
is entered as "belonging to the drawing class, heads from Nature."
In 1846 he was on March 2 examined and passed as first in his class,
the number being twenty-eight. From 1845 to 1849 Professors
Vistelious and Voivov were the masters of the life class.</p>

<p>On May 14 (1845) there was a review of troops in St. Petersburg,
and the Whistlers saw it from a window in the Prince of Oldenburg's
palace.</p>

<p>"Jemmie's eagerness to attain all his desires for information and
his fearlessness often makes him offend, and it makes him appear less
amiable than he really is. The officers, however, seemed to find amusement
in his remarks in French or English as they accosted him. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
were soon informed of his military ardour, and that he hoped to serve
his country. England? No, indeed! Russia, then? No, no;
America, of course!"</p>

<p><i>May 2</i> (1846). "The boys are in the schoolroom now, reading the
Roman history in French to M. Lamartine, promising themselves the
pleasure of reviewing the pictures at the Academy of Fine Arts at
noon, which they have enjoyed almost every day this week. It is
the Triennial Exhibition, and we like them to become familiar with
the subjects of the modern artists, and to James especially it is the
greatest treat we could offer. I went last Wednesday with Whistler
and was highly gratified. I should like to take some of the Russian
scenes so faithfully portrayed to show in my native land. My James
had described a boy's portrait said to be <i>his</i> likeness, and although the
eyes were black and the curls darker, we found it so like him that his
father said he would be glad to buy it, but its frame would only correspond
with the furniture of a palace. The boy is taken in a white
shirt with crimped frill, open at the throat; it is half-length, and no
other garment could show off the glow of the brunette complexion so
finely."</p>

<p><i>May 30</i> (1846). "Yesterday the Empress was welcomed back
to St. Petersburg. Last night the illumination which my boys had
been eagerly expecting took place. When at 10.30 they came in,
Jamie expressed such an eager desire that I would allow him to be my
escort just to take a peep at the Nevski that I could not deny him.
The effect of the light from Vasili Ostrow was very beautiful, and as
we drove along the Quai, the flowers and decorations of large mansions
were, I thought, even more tasteful. We had to fall into a line of
carriages in the Isaac Square to enter that Broadway, and just then
a shout from the populace announced to us that the Empress was
passing. I was terrified lest the poles of their carriage should run into
our backs, or that some horses might take fright or bite us, we were
so close, but Jamie laughed heartily and aloud at my timidity. He
behaved like a man. With one arm he guarded me, and with the
other kept the animals at a proper distance; and, I must confess,
brilliant as the spectacle was, <i>my</i> great pleasure was derived from the
conduct of my dear and manly boy."</p>

<p><i>July 7</i> (1846). "My two boys found much amusement in propelling
themselves on the drawbridge to and from the fancy island in
the pond at Mrs. G.'s, where we went to spend the day; they find it
such a treat to be in the country, and just run wild, chasing butterflies
and picking the wild flowers so abundant. But nothing gave them so
much pleasure as their 4th July, spent with their little American friends
at Alexandrovsky, the Eastwicks; the fireworks, percussion caps,
muskets, horseback riding, &amp;c., made them think it the most delightful
place in Russia. In some way James caught cold, and his throat was
so inflamed that leeches were applied, and he has been in consequence
confined to his room.... We spend our mornings in reading, drawing,
&amp;c. Then the boys take their row with good John across the Neva,
to the morning bath, and in the cool of the afternoon a drive to the
island, or a range in the summer gardens, or a row on the river."</p>

<p><i>July 27</i> (1846). "Last Wednesday they had another long day
in the country, and got themselves into much mischief. They had
at last broken the ropes of the drawbridge, by which it was drawn to
and from the island, and there were my wild boys prisoners on it. I
thought it best for them to remain so, as they were so unruly, but
the good-natured dominie was pressed into their service, and swimming
to their rescue, ere I could interfere; Jemmie was so drenched by
his efforts that dear Mrs. R. took him away to her room to coax him to
lie down awhile and to rub him dry, lest his sore throat return to tell
a tale of disobedience.</p>

<p>"... On Thursday there was another grand celebration of the
birthday of the Grand Duchess Olga. I gladly gave Mary permission
to take the boys in our carriage.... They were gone so long that
I grew anxious about them, but finally they arrived very tired, and
poor Mary said she never wanted to go in such a crowd again. James
had protected her as well as he was able, but she was glad to get home
safely. The boys, however, enjoyed it immensely, as they saw all the
Imperial family within arm's length, as they alighted from their pony
chaises to enter the New Palace.... We were invited to go to the
New Palace, and went immediately to the apartment occupied by his
lamented daughter. On one side is the lovely picture painted by
Buloff, so like her in life and health, though taken after death, as representing
her spirit passing upwards to the palace above the blue sky.
She wears her Imperial robes, with a crown on her head; at the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of the crown is a halo of glory&mdash;the stars surround her as she passes
through them. No wonder James should have thought this picture
the most interesting of all the works of art around us."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1846 Major Whistler "placed the boys, as boarders,
at M. Jourdan's school. My dear boys almost daily exchange <i>billet-doux</i>
with mother, since their absence of a week at a time from home.
James reported everything 'first-rate,' even to brown bread and salt
for breakfast, and greens for dinner, and both forbore to speak of
homesickness, and welcome, indeed, were they on their first Saturday
at home, when they opened the front door and called 'Mother,
Mother!' as they rushed in all in a glow, and they looked almost
handsome in their new round black cloth caps, set to one side of their
cropped heads, and the tight school uniform of grey trousers and
black jacket makes them appear taller and straighter; Jamie found
the new suit too tight for his drawing lesson, so he sacrificed vanity
to comfort, and was not diverted from his two hours' drawing by
the other boys' frolics, which argues well for his determination to
improve, as he promised his father. How I enjoyed having them
back and listening to all their chat about their school&mdash;they seemed
to enjoy their nice home tea. When it came time for them to go back,
Willie broke down and told me all he had suffered from homesickness,
and when I talked to my more manly James, I unfortunately said,
'You do not know what he feels.' Then Jamie's wounded love melted
him into tears, as he said, 'Oh! mother, you think I don't miss being
away from home!' He brushed away the shower with the back of
his hand as if he was afraid of being seen weeping. Dear boys, may
they never miss me as I miss them!"</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Mrs. Whistler's youngest son, John Bouttatz,
born in the summer of 1845, died.</p>

<p><i>November 14</i> (1846). "Jamie was kept in until night last Saturday,
and made to write a given portion of French over twenty-five times
as a punishment for stopping to talk to a classmate after their recitation,
instead of marching back to his seat according to order&mdash;poor
fellow, it was rather severe when he had looked only for rewards during
the week; as he had not had one mark of disapprobation in all that
time, and was so much elated by his number of good balls for perfect
recitations that he forgot disobedience of orders is a capital offence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
under military discipline. He lost his drawing lesson, and made us all
unhappy at home. We tried to keep his dinner hot, but his appetite
had forsaken him, although only having eaten a penny roll since breakfast&mdash;he
dashed the tears of vexation from his eyes at losing his drawing
lesson, but his cheerfulness was soon restored and we had our usual
pleasant evening."</p>

<p><i>January 23</i> (1847). "It is three weeks this afternoon since the
dear boys came home from school to spend the Russian Christmas
and holidays, and it seems not probable that they shall return again
to M. Jourdan's this winter. James was drooping from the close
confinement, and for two days was confined to his bed. Then Willie
was taken. They are quite recovered now, and skate almost daily
on the Neva, and Jamie often crosses on the ice to the Academy of
Fine Arts to spend an hour or two."</p>

<p><i>January 30</i> (1847). "Jamie was taken ill with a rheumatic attack
soon after this, and I have had my hands full, for he has suffered
much with pain and weariness, but he is gradually convalescing, and
to-day he was able to walk across the floor; he has been allowed to
amuse himself with his pencil, while I read to him; he has not taken
a dose of medicine during the attack, but great care was necessary in
his diet."</p>

<p><i>February 27</i> (1847). "Never shall I cease to record with deep
gratitude dear Jamie's unmurmuring submission these last six weeks.
He still cannot wear jacket or trousers, as the blistering still continues
on his chest. What a blessing is such a contented temper as his, so
grateful for every kindness, and rarely complains. He is now enjoying
a huge volume of Hogarth's engravings, so famous in the Gallery of
Artists. We put the immense book on the bed, and draw the great
easy-chair close up, so that he can feast upon it without fatigue. He
said, while so engaged yesterday, 'Oh, how I wish I were well; I want
so to show these engravings to my drawing-master; it is not everyone
who has a chance of seeing Hogarth's own engravings of his originals,'
and then added, in his own happy way, 'and if I had not been ill,
mother, perhaps no one would have thought of showing them to
me.'"</p>

<p>From this time until his death, Whistler maintained that Hogarth
was the greatest English artist, and never lost an opportunity of saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
so. His long illness in 1847 is therefore memorable as the beginning
of his love of Hogarth and also as a proof of his early appreciation of
great art. Curiously, in his mother's diary there is no mention of the
Hermitage, nor in his talks with us did he ever refer to it and to the
pictures there by Velasquez, the artist he later grew to admire so
enormously.</p>

<p><i>March 23</i> (1847). "After many postponements, the Emperor
finally inspected the Railroad ... and many of the Court were invited.
The day after his visit ... the Court held a <i>levée</i>, my husband
was invited; when he arrived was summoned to a private audience in
an inner apartment; the Emperor met him with marked kindness,
kissed him on each side his face, and hung an ornament suspended by a
scarlet ribbon around his neck, saying the Emperor thus conferred upon
him the Order of St. Anne. Whistler, as such honours are new to
Republicans, was somewhat abashed, but when he returned with the
Court to the large circle in the outer room, he was congratulated by
the officers generally."</p>

<p>It is said that when Major Whistler was asked to wear the Russian
uniform he refused. The decoration he could not decline.</p>

<p>Whistler told us that the Emperor was most impressed with the
way his father met every difficulty. When Major Whistler asked the
Czar how the line should be built, showing him the map of the country
between St. Petersburg and Moscow, the Czar, as everybody now
knows, took a ruler, drew a straight line from one city to the other,
and the railroad follows that ruled line. But everybody does not know
that when the rolling stock was ready it was found to have been made
of a different gauge from the rails. The people who supplied it demanded
to be paid. Major Whistler not only refused, but burnt it,
and took the responsibility.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whistler and the three children spent the summer of 1847
in England, where Major Whistler joined them. They visited their
relations, and before their return Deborah was married. She had met
Seymour Haden, a young surgeon, while staying with friends, the
Chapmans, at Preston.</p>

<p><i>October 10</i> (1847). "Deborah's wedding day. Bright and pleasant.
James the only groomsman, and very proud of the honour."</p>

<p>The next summer (1848) Mrs. Whistler went back to England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Jamie had had another of his bad attacks of rheumatic fever, cholera
broke out in St. Petersburg; "at its very name," she wrote, "my heart
failed me." On July 6 she left for London with her boys. Jamie
was better, and anxious to make a portrait of a young Hindu aboard.</p>

<p><i>July 22</i> (1848). "<i>Shanklin, Isle of Wight.</i> This is Willie's twelfth
birthday and has been devoted to his pleasure; poor Jamie was envious
that he could not bathe with us in the beautiful summer sea, for the
doctors think the bracing air as much as he can bear; we three had a
seaside ramble and then returned to rest at our cottage. I plied the
needle, while my boys amused themselves, Willie in making wax flowers
and Jemmie in drawing."</p>

<p><i>Monday</i> [<i>no date</i>]. "This day being especially fine, Mrs. P. took
the boys on a pedestrian excursion along the shore to Culver Cliffs.
In the hope that Jamie might finish his sketch of Cook's Castle, we
started the next day after an early dinner, taking a donkey with us
for fear of fatigue for James or Deborah.... We availed ourselves
of a lovely bright morning to take a drive, said to be the most charming
in England, along the south coast of the Isle as far as 'Black Gang
Chine,' where we alighted at the inn. Jamie flew off like a sea-fowl,
his sketch-book in hand, and when I finally found him, he was seated
on the red sandy beach, down, down, down, where it was with difficulty
Willie and I followed him. He was attempting the sketch of the
waterfall and cavern up the side of the precipice; he came back later,
glowing with the exercise of climbing, with sketch-book in hand, and
laughing at being 'Jacky last,' as we were all assembled for our drive
back."</p>

<p>James did not return with Mrs. Whistler. It was feared his health
would not stand another Russian winter. He stayed with the Hadens
at 62 Sloane Street, and studied with a clergyman who had one other
pupil. It was then that Boxall, commissioned by Major Whistler,
painted his portrait, "when he was fourteen years old," Mrs. Thynne,
his niece, says.</p>

<p>Mr. Alan S. Cole, C.B., recalls that "Whistler, as early as 1849, was
staying with the Hadens in Sloane Street, and went to one or two
children's parties given by the old Dilkes. To these also went my
elder sisters and Miss Thackeray and so met Jimmy. Seymour Haden
was our family doctor&mdash;with whose family ours was intimate&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>very
much on account of the early relations between my father, his
brothers, and Seymour Haden, dating from schooldays at Christ's
Hospital."</p>

<p>Major Whistler, through the summer of 1848, continued his work,
though cholera raged. In November he was attacked. He recovered,
but his health was shaken; he overtaxed his strength, and on April 9,
1849, he died: the immediate cause heart trouble, which his son
inherited. He had been employed or consulted also in the building
of the iron roof of the Riding House at St. Petersburg and the iron
bridge over the Neva, in the improvement of the Dvina at Archangel,
and the fortifications, the arsenal, and the docks at Cronstadt. He
was buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Stonington, with three of his sons,
and a monument was erected to his memory by his fellow officers in
Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The Emperor suggested, Whistler told us, that the boys should
be educated in the school for Court pages. But Mrs. Whistler determined
to take them home, and the Emperor sent her in his State
barge to the Baltic. She went to the Hadens, where she found James
grown tall and strong. In London they forgot for a moment their
sorrow in their visit to the Royal Academy (1849), in Trafalgar Square,
where Boxall's portrait of James was exhibited. A short visit to
Preston followed, the two boys carried off by "kind Aunt Alicia"
to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and then they met in Liverpool. Economy
made Mrs. Whistler hesitate between steamer and sailing-packet, but,
by the advice of George Whistler, she took the steamer <i>America</i>,
July 29, 1849, for New York, where they arrived on August 9, at once
going by boat to Stonington.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III: SCHOOLDAYS IN POMFRET.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FORTY-NINE TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY-ONE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> boys were brought up like little princes until their father's
death, which changed everything," Miss Emma W. Palmer writes
us. Major Whistler's salary was large, so were his expenses; we
have never heard there was a pension. He left his family comparatively
poor&mdash;fifteen hundred dollars a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Whistler would have preferred to stay at Stonington, but
for her two sons' sake she went to Pomfret, Connecticut, where there
was a good school, Christ Church Hall. The principal was Rev. Dr.
Roswell Park, a West Point engineer before he became parson and school
teacher. At Pomfret Mrs. Whistler made herself a home. She could
only afford part of an old farmhouse, and she felt keenly the discomfort
for her boys. Yet she kept up the old discipline. On Christmas Day
she wrote to her mother that they had been busy all morning bringing
in wood and listing draughty doors, though she allowed them to lighten
their task by hanging up evergreens and to sweeten it with "Stuart's
Candy." After a snowstorm, they had, like other boys, to shovel
paths, and all the while they had to study. "Jimmie was still an
excitable spirit with little perseverance," she wrote; however, she
would not faint but labour, and "I urged them on daily, and could
see already their exertions to overcome habits of indolence." The
Bible was read and the two boys were made to recite a verse every
morning before breakfast. Miss Palmer, their schoolmate, during
the winter of 1850, remembers that Mrs. Whistler "was very strict
with them," and describes Whistler at this period as "tall and slight,
with a pensive, delicate face, shaded by soft brown curls, one lock of
which fell over his forehead.... He had a somewhat foreign appearance
and manner, which, aided by his natural abilities, made him
very charming even at that age.... He was one of the sweetest,
loveliest boys I ever met, and was a great favourite."</p>

<p>The deepest impression he left at Pomfret was as a draughtsman.
He made caricatures and illustrations to the books he read, portraits
of his friends, and landscapes. Many of his sketches have been preserved.
The late Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, also one of his schoolmates,
describes him as "a man as fascinating as he was great, with a
charm which from the very beginning everyone who knew him recognised."
Whistler told us that he used to walk to school with her,
carrying her books and basket, and she wrote us:</p>

<p>"He was very attentive and kind; full of fun in those days. The
master of the school&mdash;Rev. Dr. Roswell Park&mdash;was one of the stiffest
and most precise of clergymen, and dressed the part. One day Whistler
came to school with a high, stiff collar and a tie precisely copied from
Dr. Park's. Of course, the schoolroom was full of suppressed laughter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
The reverend gentleman was very angry, but he could hardly take
open notice of an offence of that sort. So he bottled up his wrath,
but when Jimmy&mdash;as we used to call him in those schooldays&mdash;gave
him some trifling cause of offence, the Rev. Dr. went for him with a
ferrule. The school was in two divisions&mdash;the girls sitting on one side
of the large hall, and the boys on the other. Jimmy, pursued by the
Dr. and the ferrule, went round back of the girls' row, and threw
himself down on the floor, and the Dr. followed him and whacked
him, more, I think, to Jimmy's amusement than to his discomfort."</p>

<p>Mrs. Moulton had further recollections of the maps he drew, which
"were at once the pride and the envy of all the rest of us&mdash;they were
so perfect, so delicate, so exquisitely dainty in workmanship."</p>

<p>The work done at Pomfret by Whistler which we have seen does
not strike us as remarkable. It has its historic importance, but shows
no greater evidence of genius than the early work of any great artist.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV: WEST POINT.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY-ONE TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY-FOUR.</h2>
<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Whistler's mother was proud of his drawing, she did not
see in art a career for him. She thought he had inherited a profession
more distinguished. Many Whistlers and McNeills had been
soldiers. West Point had made of them men&mdash;Americans. West
Point must do the same for him. Through the influence of George
Whistler with Daniel Webster, he was appointed cadet At Large by
President Fillmore, and on July 1, 1851, after two years at Pomfret
school, within ten days of his seventeenth birthday, he entered the
United States Military Academy, West Point, where Colonel Robert
E. Lee was Commandant. Whistler was not made for the army any
more than Giotto for Tuscan pastures, or Corot for a Paris bonnet shop.
It was inevitable that he should fail. Yet his three years at West
Point were an experience he would not have missed.</p>

<p>The record sent to us from West Point by Colonel C. W. Larned
is: "He entered July 1, 1851, under the name of James A. Whistler;
aged sixteen years and eleven months. He was appointed At Large....
At the end of his second year, in 1853, he was absent with leave
on account of ill-health. On June 16, 1854, he was discharged from
the Academy for deficiency in chemistry. At that time he stood at
the head of his class in drawing and No. 39 in philosophy, the total
number in the class being 43."</p>

<p>The Professor of Drawing was Robert W. Weir. Mr. J. Alden
Weir, his son, remembers, "as a boy, my father showing me his work,
which at that time hung in what was known as the Gallery of the
Drawing Academy. There were about ten works by him framed.
From the start he showed evidences of a talent which later proved
to be unique in those fine and rare qualities hard to be understood by
the majority."</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Alexander S. Webb, one of Whistler's classmates,
says: "In the art class one day, while Whistler was busy over an India-ink
drawing of a French peasant girl, Weir walked, as usual, from desk
to desk, examining the pupils' work. After looking over Whistler's
shoulder he stepped back to his own desk, filled his brush with India-ink
[General Webb says he can see him now, rubbing the colour on
the slab], and approached Whistler with a view of correcting some of
the lines in the latter's drawing. When Whistler saw him coming,
he raised his hands as if to ward off the strokes of his brush, and called
out, 'Oh, don't, sir, don't! You'll spoil it!'"</p>

<p>Mr. William M. Chase told the story to Whistler and asked if there
was any truth in it. "Well, you know he would have!" said Whistler.</p>

<p>Colonel Larned writes us: "I have here two drawings made by
Whistler in his course of instruction in drawing, one of which is a
water-colour copy of a coloured print, without special merit, and much
touched up by Professor Weir, as was his wont; another, a pen-and-ink
copy also of a colour print, quite brilliant and masterful in execution,
which I presented to the officers' mess. The colour sketch bears
the ear-marks all over it of Weir's retouching. It was his habit to
touch up all water-colours of the cadets for the examination exhibition,
and I don't believe Whistler at that time had any such facility
in colour work as is indicated in this drawing. With my knowledge
of my predecessor's practice, which we instructors follow to the best
of our ability, I have always been suspicious of its integrity. At the
same time Whistler was head in drawing, and it may be that Weir
forbore in his case. The pen-and-ink, however, must have been his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
own interpretation of a colour lithograph, and shows such facility
that it makes me hesitate.</p>

<p>"Whistler did another water-colour of a monk seated at a table
by a window writing. This is also a copy of an old print which was
used by Weir through successive classes. I think it was &mdash;&mdash; who saw
the thing and wrote a lot of tommy-rot and hi-falutin about it and
Whistler's satiric genius, and his introduction in the monk's face of
that of his room-mate, assuming it to have been an original production.
As a matter of fact I have copies of the same thing by cadets in the
gallery, all touched up by Weir, and I fancy about as good as
Whistler's."</p>

<p>Of these West Point drawings, copies probably of lithographs by
Nash or Haghe, only the pen drawing gives any promise. The water-colour
is worthless. The pen drawing has in it the beginning of the
handling of his etchings. Five drawings, four of <i>An Hour in the Life of
a Cadet</i> in pen-and-ink, and one of <i>An Encampment</i> in wash, have lately
been found at West Point. The cadet drawings are far the best of his
early work that we have seen. The <i>Century Magazine</i> published
(March 1910) a lithograph, called <i>The Song of the Graduates</i>, said to be
by Whistler. It is evident, however, that if Whistler did make the
sketch, it was re-drawn by a professional lithographer at Sarony's,
who printed it. The <i>Century</i> also published (September 1910) a wood-engraving
of some class function for which he is given the credit as
draughtsman and engraver. But the work is that of a professional
wood-engraver and could not have been done by Whistler at any period
of his life. The attribution of these published prints to him is altogether
unjustified.</p>

<p>Of his other studies there is little to record. This is Colonel Larned's
account of his failure in chemistry: "Whistler said: 'Had silicon
been a gas, I would have been a major-general.' He was called up
for examination in chemistry ... and given silicon to discuss. He
began: 'I am required to discuss the subject of silicon. Silicon is a
gas.' 'That will do, Mr. Whistler,' and he retired quickly to private
life."</p>

<p>According to Colonel Larned, Whistler then appealed to General
Lee, but Lee answered, "I can only regret that one so capable of doing
well should so have neglected himself, and must suffer the penalty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Another story is of an examination in history. "What!" said
his examiner, "you do not know the date of the battle of Buena Vista?
Suppose you were to go out to dinner, and the company began to talk
of the Mexican War, and you, a West Point man, were asked the date
of the battle, what would you do?" "Do," said Whistler, "why, I
should refuse to associate with people who could talk of such things
at dinner!"</p>

<p>Whistler's horsemanship was little better. It was not unusual,
General Webb says, for him at cavalry drill to go sliding over his horse's
head. Then Major Sackett, the commander, would call out: "Mr.
Whistler, aren't you a little ahead of the squad?" Whistler said to us
Major Sackett's remark was: "Mr. Whistler, I am pleased to see you
for once at the head of your class!" "But I did it gracefully," he
insisted. There are traditions of his fall when trotting in his first
mounted drill, and the astonishment of the dragoon who ran to carry
him off to hospital, when he rose unhurt with the complaint that he
didn't "see how any man could keep a horse for amusement." Once
Whistler had to ride a horse called "Quaker." "Dragoon, what horse
is this?" "'Quaker,'" said the soldier "Well, he's no friend!" said
Whistler.</p>

<p>His observance of the regulations was often as bad as his horsemanship,
and his excuses worse. General Ruggles, a classmate, tells of
the discovery of a pair of boots which were against the regulations,
and of his writing a long explanation, winding up with the argument
that, as this demerit added but a little to the whole number, "what
boots it?"</p>

<p>General Langdon writes us: "The widow of a Colonel Thompson
occupied a set of officer's quarters at the 'Point,' and, to eke out her
pension, was allowed to take ten or twelve cadets to board. Very
soon after his admission to the Academy Whistler discovered that
the fare of the cadets was not of his taste, and he applied for permission
to take his meals at Mrs. Thompson's. Now, though her house
was in the row of officers' quarters and the nearest to the cadet barracks,
it was 'off cadet limits,' except for the boarders at meals. One
evening, long after supper, Whistler was discovered by Mrs. Thompson,
leaning over her fence, talking with her pretty French maid. Mrs.
Thompson inquired his business there. Whistler replied: 'I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
looking for my cat!' It was well known that cadets were not allowed
to keep cats, dogs, or other beasts. The old lady nearly had a fit.
As soon as she could recover she gasped out: 'Young man, go 'way!'
and sent her pretty maid indoors. Of course, Whistler took no more
meals at Mrs. Thompson's, but in the mess hall, where the fare in those
days was far from inviting."</p>

<p>Whistler told Sir Rennell Rodd another story: "The cadets were
out early one morning, engaged in surveying. It was cold and raw,
and Jimmy, finding a line of deep ditch through which he could make
a retiring movement, got back into college and his warm quarters
unperceived. By accident a roll-call was held that morning. Cadet
Whistler not being present, a report was drawn up and his name was
sent to the commanding officer as absent from parade without the
knowledge or permission of his instructor. The report was shown him,
and he said to the instructor: 'Have I your permission to speak?'
'Speak on, Cadet Whistler.' 'You have reported me, sir, for being
absent from parade without the knowledge or permission of my instructor.
Well, now, if I was absent without your knowledge or
permission, how did you know I was absent?' They got into terms
after that, and the incident closed."</p>

<p>The stories of Whistler at West Point might be multiplied. Many
have been published. The few we tell show that at the Military
Academy, as everywhere, he left his mark. We have a stronger proof
in the letters written to us by officers who were his fellow cadets.
It is half a century since they and Whistler were together, and, with
one exception, they never saw him in later years, yet their memory of
him is fresh. General D. McN. Gregg and General C. B. Comstock,
his classmates, General Loomis L. Langdon, General Henry L. Abbott,
General Oliver Otis Howard, General G. W. C. Lee, in the class before
his, have sent us their recollections. These distinguished officers agree
in their affection and their appreciation of him. He was "a vivacious
and likeable little fellow," General Comstock says, and we get a picture
of him, short and slight, not over military in his bearing, somewhat
foreign in appearance, near-sighted, and with thick, black curls that
won him the name of "Curly." Others remember his wit, his pranks,
his fondness for cooking and the excellence of his dishes; his excursions
"after taps," for buckwheat cakes and oysters or ice-cream and
soda-water to Joe's, and, for heavier fare, to Benny Haven's a mile
away, a serious offence; they remember his indifference to discipline,
and the number of his demerits, which they excuse as "not indicating
any moral obliquity," but due to such harmless faults as "lates,"
"absences," "clothing out of order"; most of all, they remember
his drawings&mdash;his caricatures of the cadets, the Board of Visitors,
the masters, his sketches scribbled over his text-books, his illustrations
to Dickens, Dumas, Victor Hugo. General Langdon recalls a picture
that he and Whistler painted together. Whistler gave these drawings
away, and many have been preserved. Even the cover of a geometry
book, on which he sketched and noted bets with General Webb, was
kept by his room-mate, Frederick L. Childs&mdash;<i>Les Enfants</i> Whistler
called him.</p>

<p>Whistler looked back to West Point with equal affection. He
failed, but West Point was the basis of his code of conduct. As a
"West Point man" he met every emergency, and his bearing, his
carriage, showed the influence of those days when he liked to look back
to himself "very dandy in grey." For the discipline, the tradition,
the tone of the Academy he never lost his respect. He knew what it
could do in making men of boys. "From the moment we came,"
he said to us, "we were United States officers, not schoolboys, not
college students. We were ruled, not by little school or college rules,
but by our honour, by our deference to the unwritten law of tradition."
He resented the least innovation that threatened the hold of this
tradition over the cadets. "To take a cadet into court was destruction
to the <i>morale</i> of West Point; it was such a disgrace to offend against
the unwritten laws that the offender's career was ruined." In the
most trivial matters he deplored deviation from the old standard.
That was the reason of his indignation when he heard that cadets
were playing football, and, worse, playing against college teams;
to put themselves on the level of students "was beneath the dignity
of officers of the United States." During our war with Spain, and the
Boers' struggle in South Africa, there was not an event, not a rumour,
that he did not refer to West Point and its code. The Spanish War,
though, "no doubt, we should never have gone into it, was the most
wonderful, the most beautiful war since Louis XIV. Never in modern
times has there been such a war; it was conducted on correct West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Point principles, with the most perfect courtesy and dignity on both
sides, and the greatest chivalry." When he came back to London from
Corsica in 1901, and was telling us of the people and the way they clung
to old custom and ceremonial, he said that he had found "the Roman
tradition almost as fine as the West Point tradition," and this was a
concession. We never knew him to show the least desire to return
to Lowell or Stonington, to Pomfret or Washington, but he said, "If
I ever make the journey to America, I will go straight to Baltimore,
then to West Point, and then sail for England again." One evening
we asked him to meet an officer just from West Point. His interest
could not have been keener, had he left the Academy the day before.
He wanted to know about everything&mdash;the buildings, the life, the
discipline. He deplored every innovation, always, above all, football:
West Point to him was in danger when cadets could stoop to dispute
"with college students for a dirty ball kicked round a muddy field."
This was the shadow thrown over his pleasure when he heard of the
pride the Academy took in claiming him, of his reputation there, of
his drawings hanging in places of honour. It was the military side
of the Academy, however, that stirred him to enthusiasm. His face
fell when, asking the officer, who, like Major Whistler, was in the
artillery, "Professor of Tactics, I suppose?" the officer answered, "No,
of French." He showed his affection for the Military Academy by
sending to the library a copy of <i>Whistler</i> v. <i>Ruskin: Art and Art
Critics</i>, with autograph notes and on the title-page the inscription:
"From an old cadet whose pride it is to remember his West Point
days." This is signed with the butterfly, and newspaper cuttings
about the trial are pasted at the end of the book. The authorities at
West Point have honoured him by placing a memorial tablet, one of
St. Gaudens' last works, in the library of the Academy, and at the
suggestion of the late Major Zalinski, a number of American artists
have given a series of works to the Academy in his honour. In this
collection Whistler alone is not represented, we believe.</p>

<p>But it needs more than respect and love for the Military Academy
to make a soldier, and Whistler, like Poe before him, was an alien at
West Point. It was no question of the number of his demerits, or
of his ignorance of chemistry and history; he had something else to
do in life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V: THE COAST SURVEY.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
FIFTY-FOUR AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY-FIVE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Whistler left West Point in 1854 he had not only to face the
disappointment of his mother, but to find another career. The plan
now was to apprentice him to Mr. Winans, in the locomotive works
at Baltimore.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick B. Miles writes us: "It was in 1854 that I first
met Whistler in Baltimore, after he left West Point, at the house of
Thomas Winans, who had returned from Russia. I was apprenticed
to the loco. works of old Mr. Ross Winans, Thomas Winans' father.
His elder brother, George Whistler, was a friend of my family; had
been superintendent of the New York and New Haven Railroad, and
had married Miss Julia Winans, sister of Thomas Winans, then came
into the loco. works as partner and superintendent. I was in the
drawing-room under him.</p>

<p>"Whistler was staying with Tom Winans or his brother, George
Whistler. They were perplexed at his 'flightiness'&mdash;wanted him to
enter the loco. works. His younger brother William was an apprentice
along with me. But Jem never really worked. He spent much of his
several short stays and two long ones in Baltimore loitering about
the drawing-office and shops, and at my drawing-desk in Tom Winans'
house. We all had boards with paper, carefully stretched, which Jem
would cover with sketches, to our great disgust, obliging us to stretch
fresh ones, but we loved him all the same. He would also ruin all
our best pencils, sketching not only on the paper, but also on the
smoothly finished wooden backs of the drawing-boards, which, I think,
he preferred to the paper side. We kept some of the sketches for a long
time. I had a beauty&mdash;a cavalier in a dungeon cell, with one small
window high up. In all his work at that time he was very Rembrandtesque,
but, of course, only amateurish. Nevertheless he was studying
and working out effects."</p>

<p>Whistler saw enough of the locomotive works to know that he did
not want to be an apprentice, and it was not long before he left Baltimore
for Washington. To us he spoke as if he had gone to Washington
straight from West Point. He was with us on the evening of September
15, 1900, after the news had come from the Transvaal of President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Kruger's flight, and our talking of it led him back to West Point, and so
to the story of his days in the service of the Government. He followed
the Boer War with intense interest:</p>

<p>"The Boers are as fine as the Southerners&mdash;their fighting would be
no discredit to West Point," and he was indignant with us for looking
upon Kruger's flight as diplomatically a blunder. "Diplomatically
it was right, you know, the one thing Kruger should have done, just
as, in that other amazing campaign, flight had been the one thing
for Jefferson Davis, a Southern gentleman who had the code. I shall
always remember the courtesy shown me by Jefferson Davis, through
whom I got my appointment in the Coast Survey.</p>

<p>"It was after my little difference with the Professor of Chemistry
at West Point. The Professor would not agree with me that silicon
was a gas, but declared it was a metal; and as we could come to no
agreement in the matter, it was suggested&mdash;all in the most courteous
and correct West Point way&mdash;that perhaps I had better leave the
Academy. Well, you know, it was not a moment for the return of
the prodigal to his family or for any slaying of fatted calves. I had
to work, and I went to Washington. There I called at once on Jefferson
Davis, who was Secretary of War&mdash;a West Point man like myself.
He was most charming, and I&mdash;well, from my Russian cradle, I had an
idea of things, and the interview was in every way correct, conducted on
both sides with the utmost dignity and elegance. I explained my unfortunate
difference with the Professor of Chemistry&mdash;represented that
the question was one of no vital importance, while on all really important
questions I had carried off more than the necessary marks.
My explanation made, I suggested that I should be reinstated at West
Point, in which case, as far as I was concerned, silicon should remain
a metal. The Secretary, courteous to the end, promised to consider
the matter, and named a day for a second interview.</p>

<p>"Before I went back to the Secretary of War, I called on the
Secretary of the Navy, also a Southerner, James C. Dobbin, of South
Carolina, suggesting that I should have an appointment in the Navy.
The Secretary objected that I was too young. In the confidence of
youth, I said age should be no objection; I 'could be entered at the
Naval Academy, and the three years at West Point could count at
Annapolis.' The Secretary was interested, for he, too, had a sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
things. He regretted, with gravity, the impossibility. But something
impressed him; for, later, he reserved one of six appointments
he had to make in the marines and offered it to me. In the meantime,
I had returned to the Secretary of War, who had decided that it was
impossible to meet my wishes in the matter of West Point; West Point
discipline had to be observed, and if one cadet were reinstated, a dozen
others who had tumbled out after me would have to be reinstated
too. But if I would call on Captain Benham, of the Coast Survey,
a post might be waiting for me there."</p>

<p>Captain Benham was a friend of his father, and Whistler was engaged
in the drawing division of the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey, at the salary of a dollar and a half a day. This appointment he
received on November 7, 1854, six months after he had left West Point.
There was nothing to appeal to him in the routine of the office. What
he had to do he did, but with no enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I was apt to be late, I was so busy socially. I lived in a small
room, but it was amazing how I was asked and went everywhere&mdash;to
balls, to the Legations, to all that was going on. Labouchere, an
<i>attaché</i> at the British Legation, has never ceased to talk of me, so gay,
and, when I had not a dress suit, pinning up the tails of my frock-coat,
and turning it into a dress-coat for the occasion. Shocking!"</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere has told this story in a letter to us: "I did know
Whistler very well in America about fifty years ago. But he was
then a young man at Washington, who&mdash;if I remember rightly&mdash;had
not been able to pass his examination at West Point and had given
no indication of his future fame. He was rather hard up, I take it, for
I remember that he pinned back the skirt of a frock-coat to make it
pass as a dress-coat at evening parties. Washington was then a small
place compared with what it is now, where everybody&mdash;so to say&mdash;knew
everybody, and the social parties were of a simple character.
This is really all that I remember of Whistler at that time, except
that he was thought witty and paradoxically amusing!"</p>

<p>But long before something in his dress drew attention to him.
Though he was never seen in the high-standing collar and silk hat
of the time, some remember him in a Scotch cap and a plaid shawl
thrown over his shoulder, then the fashion; others recall a slouch
hat and cloak, his coat, unbuttoned, showing his waistcoat; while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
traditions of his social charm come from every side. Adjutant-General
Breck is responsible for the story of Whistler having invited the Russian
Minister&mdash;others say the <i>Chargé  d'Affaires</i>&mdash;Edward de Stoeckl, to
dine with him, carrying the Minister off in his own carriage, doing the
marketing by the way, and cooking the dinner before his guest in the
room where he lived. And it has been said that never was the Minister
entertained by so brilliant a host while in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. John Ross Key, a fellow draughtsman in the Coast Survey,
says that this room was in a house in Thirteenth Street, near Pennsylvania
Avenue, and that Whistler usually dined in a restaurant close
by, kept by a Mr. and Mrs. A. Gautier. According to the late A.
Lindenkohl, another fellow draughtsman, Whistler also lived for a while
in a house at the north-east corner of E. and Twelfth Streets, a two-storey
brick building which has lately been pulled down. He occupied
a plainly but comfortably furnished room, for which he paid ten dollars
a month. The office records show that he worked six and one-half
days in January, and five and three-fourths in February. He usually
arrived late, but, he would say, it was not his fault. "I was not too
late; the office opened too early." Lindenkohl described an effort to
reform him:</p>

<p>"Captain Benham took occasion to tell me that he felt great interest
in the young man, not only on account of his talents, but also on account
of his father, and he told me that he would be highly pleased if I could
induce Whistler to be more regular in his attendance. 'Call at his
lodgings on your way to the office,' he said, 'and see if you can't bring
him along.'</p>

<p>"Accordingly, one morning, I called at Whistler's lodgings at
half-past eight. No doubt he felt somewhat astonished, but received
me with the greatest <i>bonhomie</i> invited me to make myself at home,
and promised to make all possible haste to comply with my wishes.
Nevertheless he proceeded with the greatest deliberation to rise from
his couch and put himself into shape for the street and prepare his
breakfast, which consisted of a cup of strong coffee brewed in a steam-tight
French machine, then a novelty, and also insisted upon treating
me with a cup. We made no extra haste on our way to the office,
which we reached about half-past ten&mdash;an hour and a half after time.
I did not repeat the experiment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Lindenkohl said that Whistler spoke of Paris with enthusiasm, that
he sketched sometimes from the office windows, and made studies of
people, taking the greatest interest in the arrangement and folds of
their clothes. Whistler showed him "several examples done with the
brush in sepia, in old French or Spanish styles," whatever this may
mean. Mr. Key describes Whistler as "painfully near-sighted," and
always sketching, even on the walls as he went downstairs. Though
in Washington only a few months, he left the impression of his indifference
to work except in the one form in which work interested
him&mdash;his art.</p>

<p>If nothing else were known of this period, it would be memorable
for the technical instruction he received in the Coast Survey. His
work was the drawing and etching of Government topographical plans
and maps, which have to be made with the utmost accuracy and sharpness
of line. His training, therefore, was in the hardest and most
perfect school of etching in the world, a fact never until now pointed
out. The work was dull, mechanical, and he sometimes relieved the
dullness by filling empty spaces on the plates with sketches. Captain
Benham told him plainly, Whistler said, that he was not there to spoil
Government coppers, and ordered all the designs to be immediately
erased. This was Whistler's account to us. But Mr. Key, in his
<i>Recollections of Whistler</i>, published in the <i>Century Magazine</i> (April 1908),
says that these sketches were confined to the experimental plate given
to Whistler, as to all beginners, and he adds that he watched Whistler
through the process of preparing and etching it.</p>

<p>Only two plates have been as yet, or probably ever will be, found
in the office that can be attributed, wholly or in part, to Whistler:
the <i>Coast Survey, No. 1</i>, and <i>Coast Survey, No. 2</i>, <i>Anacapa Island</i>, first
described in the <i>Catalogue of the Whistler Memorial Exhibition</i> in
London, 1905. The <i>Coast Survey, No. 1</i>, is a plate giving two parallel
views, one above the other, of the coast-line of a rocky shore, the lower
showing a small town in a deep bay with, below them both to the extreme
left, a profile map. Whistler was unable to confine himself to
the Government requirements. In the lower design, chimneys are
gaily smoking, and on the upper part of the plate several figures,
obviously reminiscent of prints and drawings, are sketched: an old
peasant woman; a man in a tall Italian hat, or, Mr. Key says, Whistler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
himself as a Spanish hidalgo; another in a Sicilian bonnet; a mother
and child in an oval, meant for Mrs. Partington and Ike, as Mr. Key
remembers; a battered French soldier; a bearded monk in a cowl.
The drawing is schoolboy-like, though it shows certain observation,
but the biting is remarkable. The little figures are bitten as well and in
the same way as <i>La Vieille aux Loques</i>, etched three or four years
afterwards; to look at them is to know that Whistler was a consummate
etcher technically before he left the Coast Survey. There is no
advance in the biting of the French series. So astonishing is this
mastery that, if the technique in some of the French plates were not
similar, one would be tempted to doubt whether Whistler etched those
little figures in Washington, especially as the plate is unsigned. The
plate escaped by chance. Mr. Key, to whom it was given to clean off
and use again, asked to keep it, and it was sold to him for the price
of old copper. It is still in existence.</p>

<p>The second plate, <i>Anacapa Island</i>, is signed with several names.
Whistler etched the view of the eastern extremity of the island, for
many lines on the rocky shore resemble the work in the French series,
and also the two flights of birds which, though they enliven the design,
have no topographical value. This plate was finished and published
in the Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, 1855. There
is said to be a third plate, a chart of the Delaware River, but we have
never seen it and can find out nothing about it.</p>

<p>One other record of Whistler at the Coast Survey remains, but of
a different kind. He liked to tell the story. Captain Benham used
to come and look through the small magnifying glass each draughtsman
in this department had to work with. One day, Whistler etched a
little devil on the glass, and Captain Benham looked through it at the
plate. Whistler described himself to us, lying full length on a sort of
mattress or trestle, so as not to touch the copper. But he saw Captain
Benham give a jump. The captain said nothing. He pocketed the
glass, and that was all Whistler heard of it until many years afterwards,
when, one day, an old gentleman appeared at his studio in Paris, and
by way of introduction took from his watch-chain a tiny magnifying
glass, and asked Whistler to look through it&mdash;"and," he said, "well&mdash;we
recognised each other perfectly."</p>

<p>Captain Benham is dead, but his son, Major H. H. Benham, writes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
us: "I have heard my father tell the story. He was very fond of
Whistler, and thought most highly of his great ability&mdash;or rather
genius, I should say."</p>

<p>Genius like Whistler's served him as little at the Coast Survey as
at West Point. He resigned in February 1855. His brother, George
Whistler, and Mr. Winans tried again to make him enter the locomotive
works in Baltimore. He was twenty-one, old enough to insist
upon what he wanted; and what he wanted was to study art. Already
at St. Petersburg his ability had struck his mother's friends. At
Pomfret and West Point he owed to his drawing whatever distinction
he had attained. And there had been things done outside of school
and Academy and office work, he told us&mdash;"portraits of my cousin
Annie Denny and of Tom Winans, and many paintings at Stonington
that Stonington people remembered so well they looked me up in
Paris afterwards. Indeed, all the while, ever since my Russian days,
there had been always the thought of art, and when at last I told the
family that I was going to Paris, they said nothing. There was no difficulty.
They just got me a ticket. I was to have three hundred and
fifty dollars (seventy pounds) a year, and my stepbrother, George
Whistler, who was one of my guardians, sent it to me after that every
quarter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI: STUDENT DAYS IN THE LATIN QUARTER.<br />
THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY-FIVE TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY-NINE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> arrived in Paris in the summer of 1855. There he fell
among friends. The American Legation was open to the son of Major
Whistler. It was the year of the first International Exhibition, and
Sir Henry Cole, the British Commissioner, the Thackerays, and the
Hadens were there. Lady Ritchie (Miss Thackeray) writes:</p>

<p>"I wish I had a great deal more to tell you about Whistler. I
always enjoyed talking to him when we were both hobbledehoys at
Paris; he used to ask me to dance, and rather to my disappointment
perhaps, for, much as I liked talking to him, I preferred dancing, we
used to stand out while the rest of the party polkaed and waltzed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
There was a certain definite authority in the things he said, even as
a boy. I can't remember what they were, but I somehow realised
that what he said mattered. When I heard afterwards of his fanciful
freaks and quirks, I could not fit them in with my impression of the
wise young oracle of my own age."</p>

<p>George Whistler wanted him to go to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts,
but there is no record of his having been admitted. He went instead
to the studio Gleyre inherited from Delaroche and handed on to
Gérôme, which drew to it all the students who did not crowd to
Couture and Ary Scheffer. It was not extraordinary, as some have
said, that Whistler should have gone there; it would have been extraordinary
had he stayed away. He arrived in Paris when Courbet,
slighted at the International, was defying convention with his first show
and his first "Manifesto," and many of the younger men were throwing
over Romanticism for Realism. Whistler found himself more in
sympathy with the followers of Courbet than with Gleyre's pupils,
and he became so intimate with the group, among whom were Fantin
and Degas, who studied under Lecocq de Boisbaudran, that it is sometimes
thought he must have worked in that school. But on his arrival
in Paris the young American had heard neither of Lecocq de Boisbaudran
nor Courbet, and Gleyre was the popular teacher. Fantin-Latour
and M. Duret both have said that they seldom heard Whistler
speak of Gleyre's. When we asked him about it, he only recalled
the dignified principles upon which it was conducted. There was not
even the case of the <i>nouveau</i> "If a man was a decent fellow, and
would sing his song, and take a little chaff, he had no trouble." Whistler
could remember only one disagreeable incident, in connection, not
with a <i>nouveau</i>, but an unpopular student who had been there some
time and put on airs. One morning, Whistler told us, he came to
the studio late, "and there were all the students working away very
hard, the unpopular one among them, and there, at the end of the
room, on the model's stand was an enormous catafalque, the unpopular
one's name on it in big letters. And no one said a word.
But that killed him. He was never again seen in the place."</p>

<p>Gleyre was by no means colourless as a teacher. He is remembered
as the successor of David and the Classicists, but he held theories
disquieting to academic minds. He taught that before a picture was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
begun the colours should be arranged on the palette: in this way,
he said, difficulties were overcome, for attention could be given solely
to the drawing and modelling on canvas in colour. He taught also
that ivory-black is the base of tone. Upon this preparation of the
palette and this base of black&mdash;upon black, "the universal harmoniser"&mdash;Whistler
founded his practice as painter, and as teacher when he
visited the pupils of the <i>Académie Carmen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As he has told us over
and over again, his practice of a lifetime was derived from what he
learned in the schools, and the master's methods he never abandoned.
He only developed methods, misunderstood by those British prophets
who have said he had but enough knowledge for his own needs.</p>

<p>Whistler spoke often to us of the men he met at Gleyre's: Poynter,
Du Maurier, Lamont, Joseph Rowley. Leighton, in 1855, was studying
at Couture's, developing his theory that "the best dodge is to be
a devil of a clever fellow," and Mrs. Barrington says he made Whistler's
acquaintance at the time and admired Whistler's etchings. But
Whistler never recalled Leighton among his fellow students, though
he spoke often with affection of Thomas Armstrong, who worked
at Ary Scheffer's, and Aleco Ionides, not an art student but studying,
no one seemed to know what or where. This is the group in Du
Maurier's novel of Paris student life, <i>Trilby</i>. It is regrettable that
Du Maurier cherished his petty spite against Whistler for twenty-five
years and then printed it, and so wrecked what Whistler imagined
a genuine friendship. Lamont, "the Laird," Rowley, the "Taffy,"
Aleco Ionides, "the Greek," and Thomas Armstrong are dead. Sir
Edward J. Poynter remains, and also Mr. Luke Ionides, who was then
often in Paris. He has given us his impressions of Whistler at the
time:</p>

<p>"I first knew Jimmie Whistler in the month of August 1855. My
younger brother was with a tutor, and had made friends with Jimmie.
He was just twenty-one years old, full of life and go, always ready for
fun, good-natured and good-tempered. He wore a peculiar straw hat,
slightly on the side of his head&mdash;it had a low crown and a broad brim."</p>

<p>Whistler etched himself in this hat, which startled even artists
and students, and became a legend in the Latin Quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowley wrote us: "It was in 1857-8 that I knew Whistler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and a most amusing and eccentric fellow he was, with his long, black,
thick, curly hair, and large felt hat with a broad black ribbon round
it. I remember on the wall of the <i>atelier</i> was a representation of him,
I believe done by Du Maurier, a sketch of him, then a fainter one,
and then merely a note of interrogation&mdash;very clever it was and very
like the original. In those days he did not work hard, and I have a
faint recollection of seeing a head painted by him in deep Rembrandtish
tones which was thought very good indeed. He was always smoking
cigarettes, which he made himself, and his droll sayings caused us
no end of fun. I don't think he stayed long in any rooms. One
day he told us he had taken a new one, and he was fitting it up <i>peu
à peu</i> and he had already got a <i>tabouret</i> and a chair. He told me
tales of being invited to a reception at the American Minister's, but,
as he had no dress suit to go in, he had to borrow Poynter's, who
fitted him out, all except his boots. So he waited until the guests
at the hotel had retired, when he went round the corridors, found
what he wanted, and left them at the door on his return. It was
more his manner and the clever way he told the tale that amused
us.... I have his first twelve etchings, which he did in 1858. I
never saw him after I left Paris that year. He was never a friend
of mine, and it was only occasionally he came to see us at the <i>atelier</i>
in Notre-Dame-des-Champs."</p>

<p>Whistler was intimate for awhile with Sir Edward J. Poynter, who
scarcely seems to have understood him. To Poynter Whistler was
the "Idle Apprentice." In his speech at the first Royal Academy
Banquet (April 30, 1904) after Whistler's death, Poynter said:
"Thrown very intimately in Whistler's company in early days, I
knew him well when he was a student in Paris&mdash;that is, if he could
be called a student, who, to my knowledge, during the two or three
years when I was associated with him, devoted hardly as many weeks
to study. His genius, however, found its way in spite of an excess
of the natural indolence of disposition and love of pleasure of which
a certain share has been the hereditary attribute of the art student."
And this bit of insolence was the final tribute to his memory paid by
British Official Art.</p>

<p>"Whistler was never wholly one of us," Armstrong told us.
Whistler laughed at the Englishmen and their ways, above all at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
boxing and sparring matches in their studios; "he could not see
why they didn't hire the <i>concierges</i> to do their fighting for them."
But he understood the French, and they understood him. He could
speak their language, he knew Murger by heart before he came to
Paris, and there got to know him personally. Mr. Ionides says that
once, on the <i>rive gauche</i>, they met Murger, and Whistler introduced
him. Whistler delighted in the humour and picturesqueness of it,
and was always quoting Murger. The Englishmen at Gleyre's were
puzzled by him and his "no shirt friends" as he called one group of
students. Every now and then they palled, even on him, and he
would then tell the Englishmen that he "must give up the 'no shirt'
set and begin to live cleanly." The end came when, during an absence
from Paris, he lent them his room, luxurious from the student standpoint,
with a tin bath and blue china. The "no shirt friends" could
not change their habits with their surroundings. They made grogs in
the bath; they never washed a plate, but when one side was dirty,
ate off the other, and Whistler had not bargained to make his room
the background for a new chapter in the <i>Vie de Bohèm</i>. But this
was later, after his adventures with them had been the gossip of the
Quarter, and had confirmed the diligent English in their impressions
of his idleness.</p>

<p>Among the French he made friends: Aubert, the first man he knew
in Paris, a clerk in the Crédit Fonder; Fantin; Legros; Becquet,
a musician; Henri Martin, son of the historian; Drouet, the sculptor;
Henry Oulevey and Ernest Delannoy, painters. From Fantin we have
notes made just before his death. Legros prefers to remember nothing,
the friendship in his case ending many years ago. Drouet and Oulevey
have told us almost as much as Whistler did of those days. When
Oulevey first knew him, Whistler lived in a little hotel in the Rue
St. Sulpice; then he moved to No. 1 Rue  Bourbon-le-Château, near
St. Germain-des-Prés; and then to No. 3 Rue Campagne-Première,
where Drouet had a studio. When remittances ran out, he climbed
six flights and shared a garret with Delannoy, the Ernest of the stories
Whistler liked best to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. Miles writes us that he came to Paris in May 1857, with letters
from Whistler's family and a draft for him: "At the Beaux-Arts
he was not to be found, but I got his address. He had gone from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
that. I was in despair, but went to the Luxembourg, hoping to find
some trace of him. In looking at a picture, I backed into an easel,
heard a muttered damn behind me&mdash;and there was Whistler painting
busily. He took me to his quarters in a little back street, up ten
flights of stairs&mdash;a tiny room with a brick floor, a cot bed, a chair
on which were a basin and pitcher&mdash;and that was all! We sat on
the cot and talked as cheerfully as if in a palace&mdash;and he got the
draft. 'Now,' said he, 'I shall move downstairs, and begin all over
again&mdash;furnish my room comfortably. You see, I have just eaten my
washstand and borrowed a little, hoping the draft would arrive. Have
been living for some time on my wardrobe. You are just in time;
don't know what I should have done, but it often happens this way!
I first eat a wardrobe, and then move upstairs a flight or two, but
seldom get so high as this before the draft comes!' How true this
is I can't say, but it sounds probable and very like Whistler at that
age&mdash;he was then about twenty-three or just twenty-four at most&mdash;May
1857. Then Whistler showed me Paris: I met some of his
painter friends. I remember only Lambert (French) and Poynter
(English)&mdash;now a great swell. Whistler didn't care much for Poynter
at that time, but was witty and amusing, as usual. He dined with
me at the best restaurant in Paris, which he had not done for a long
time, and dined me, the next day, at a little <i>crémerie</i> to show what
his usual fare had been, and, indeed, usually was when the time was
approaching for the arrival of his allowance."</p>

<p>The restaurant to which Whistler and his friends usually went
was Lalouette's, famous for a wonderful Burgundy at one franc the
bottle, <i>le cachet vert</i>, ordered on great occasions, and more famous
now for <i>Bibi Lalouette</i>, the subject of the etching, the child of the
<i>patron</i>. Lalouette, like Siron at Barbizon, understood artists, and gave
credit. Whistler, when he left Paris, owed Lalouette three thousand
francs, every <i>sou</i> of which was paid, though it took a long time. To-day,
unfortunately, such debts are not always discharged, and the
charming system of other days exists no longer. They also dined
at Madame Bachimont's in the Place de la Sorbonne, a <i>crémerie</i>,
where Whistler once gave a dinner to the American Consul, and invited
"<i>Canichon</i>," the daughter of the house, and bought her a new hat
for the occasion&mdash;a tremendous sensation through the Quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Drouet did not think that Whistler worked much. "He was
every evening at the students' balls, and never got up until eleven
or twelve in the morning, so where was the time for work?" Oulevey
cannot remember his doing much at Gleyre's, or in the Luxembourg,
or at the Louvre, but he was always drawing the people and the scenes
of the Quarter. In the memory of both his work is overshadowed
by his gaiety and his wit, his <i>blague</i>, his charm: "<i>tout à fait un homme
à part</i>," is Oulevey's phrase, with "<i>un c&oelig;ur de femme et une volonté
d'homme</i>." Anything might be expected of him, and Drouet added
that he was quick to resent an insult, always "<i>un petit rageur</i>." George
Boughton, of a younger generation, when he came to the Quarter,
found that all stories of larks were put down to Whistler. Mr. Luke
Ionides writes:</p>

<p>"He was a great favourite among us all, and also among the <i>grisettes</i>
we used to meet at the gardens where dancing went on. I remember
one especially&mdash;they called her the <i>Tigresse</i>. She seemed madly in
love with Jimmie and would not allow any other woman to talk to him
when she was present. She sat to him several times with her curly
hair down her back. She had a good voice, and I often thought she
had suggested Trilby to Du Maurier."</p>

<p>She was the model for <i>Fumette</i>, Eloise, a little <i>modiste</i>, who knew
Musset by heart and recited his verses to Whistler, and who one day in
a rage tore up, not his etchings as Mr. Wedmore says, as often, wrongly,
but his drawings. Whistler was living in the Rue St. Sulpice, and the
day he came home and found the pieces piled high on the table he
wept.</p>

<p>Another figure was <i>La Mère Gérard</i>. She was old and almost
blind, was said to have written verse, and so come down in the world.
She sold violets and matches at the gate of the Luxembourg. She was
very paintable as she sat huddled up on the steps, and he got her to
pose for him many times. She said she had a tapeworm, and if in the
studio he asked her what she would eat or drink, her answer was,
"<i>Du lait: il aimé ça!</i>" They used to chaff him about her in the
Quarter. Once, Lalouette invited all his clients to spend a day in the
country, and Whistler accepted on condition that he could bring
<i>La Mère Gérard</i>. She arrived, got up in style, sat at his side in the
carriage in which they all drove off, and grew livelier as the day went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
on. He painted her in the afternoon: the portrait a success, he
promised it to her, but first took it back to the studio to finish. Then
he fell ill and was sent to England. When he returned and saw the
portrait again, he thought it too good for <i>La Mère Gérard</i>. He made
a copy for the old lady, who saw the difference and was furious. Not
long after he was walking past the Luxembourg with Lamont. The
old woman, huddled on the steps, did not look up:</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien, Madame Gérard, comment ça va?</i>" Lamont asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Assez bien, Monsieur, assez bien.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>It votre petit Américain?</i>"</p>

<p>To which she replied, not looking up, "<i>Lui? On dit qu'il a craqué!
Encore une espèce de canaille de moins!</i>"</p>

<p>And Whistler laughed, and she knew him, as so many were to know
him, by that laugh all his life.</p>

<p>For ages after, in the Quarter, he was called "<i>Espèce de canaille</i>."
And this is where Du Maurier got the story which he tells in <i>Trilby</i>&mdash;as
he got all <i>Trilby</i>, in fact.</p>

<p>Another character in the Quarter of whom Whistler never tired
of telling us was the Count de Montezuma, the delightful, inimitable,
impossible, incredible Montezuma, not a student, not a painter, but
one after Whistler's heart. He never had a <i>sou</i>, but always cheek
enough to see him through. Whistler told us of him:</p>

<p>"This is the sort of thing he would do, and with an air&mdash;amazing!
He started one day for Charenton on the steamboat, his pockets, as
usual, empty, and he was there for as long as he could stay. The boat
broke down, a <i>sergent de ville</i> came on board and ordered everybody
off except the captain and his family, who happened to be with him.
The Montezuma paid no attention. With arms crossed, he walked
up and down, looking at no one. They waited, but he walked on,
up and down, up and down, looking at no one. The <i>sergent de ville</i>
repeated, '<i>Tout le monde à terre!</i>' The Montezuma gave no sign.
'<i>Et vous?</i>' the <i>sergent de ville</i> asked at last. '<i>Je suis de la famille!</i>'
said the Montezuma. Opposite, staring at him, stood the captain
with his wife and children. 'You see,' said the <i>sergent de ville</i>, 'the
captain does not know you, he says you are not of the family. You
must go.' '<i>Moi,</i>' and the Montezuma drew himself up proudly,
'<i>Moi! je suis le bâtard!</i>'"</p>

<p>Though he was frequently hard up, Whistler's income seemed
princely to students who lived on nothing. When there was money
in his pockets, Mr. Ionides says, he spent it royally on others. When
his pockets were empty, he managed to refill them in a way that still
amazes Oulevey, who told us of the night when, after the <i>café</i> where
they had squandered their last <i>sous</i> on kirsch had closed, he and Lambert
and Whistler adjourned to the Halles for supper, ordered the best,
and ate it. Then he and Lambert stayed in the restaurant as hostages,
while Whistler, at dawn, went off to find the money. He was back
when they awoke, with three or four hundred francs in his pocket.
He had been to see an American friend, he said, a painter: "And do
you know, he had the bad manners to abuse the situation; he insisted
on my looking at his pictures!"</p>

<p>There were times when everybody failed, even Mr. Lucas, George
Whistler's friend, who was living in Paris and often came to his rescue.
One summer day he pawned his coat when he was penniless and wanted
an iced drink in a <i>buvette</i> across the way from his rooms in Rue Bourbon-le-Château.
"What would you?" he said. "It is warm!" And
for the next two or three days he went in shirt-sleeves. From Mr.
Ionides we have heard how Whistler and Ernest Delannoy carried
their straw mattresses to the nearest <i>Mont-de-Piété</i>, stumbling up
three flights of stairs under them, and were refused an advance by the
man at the window. "<i>C'est bien</i>," said Ernest with his grandest
air. "<i>C'est bien. J'enverrai un commissionnaire!</i>" And they dropped
the mattresses and walked out with difficulty, to go bedless home.
Then there was a bootmaker to whom Whistler owed money, and who
appeared with his bill, refusing to move unless he was paid. Whistler
was courtesy itself, and, regretting his momentary embarrassment,
begged the bootmaker to accept an engraving of Garibaldi, which he
ventured to admire. The bootmaker was so charmed that he spoke no
more of his bill, but took another order on the spot, and made new shoes
into the bargain.</p>

<p>Many of the things told of Whistler he used to tell us of Ernest
or the others. Ernest he said it was, though some say it was Whistler,
who had a commission to copy in the Louvre, but no canvas, paints,
or brushes, and not a <i>sou</i> to buy them with. However, he went to
the gallery in the morning, the first to arrive, and his businesslike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
air disarmed the <i>gardien</i> as he picked out an easel, a clean canvas, a
palette, a brush or two, and a stick of charcoal. He wrote his name in
large letters on the back of the canvas, and, when the others began to
drop in, was too busy to see anything but his work. Presently there
was a row. What! an easel missing, a canvas gone, brushes not to
be found! The <i>gardien</i> bustled round. Everybody talked at once.
Ernest looked up in a fury&mdash;shameful! Why should he be disturbed?
What was it all about, anyhow? When he heard what had happened
no one was louder. It had come to a pretty pass in the Louvre when
you couldn't leave your belongings overnight without having them
stolen! Things at last quieted down. Ernest finished his charcoal
sketch, but his palette was bare. He stretched, jumped down from his
high stool, strolled about, stopped to criticise here, to praise there,
until he saw the colours he needed. The copy of the man who owned
them ravished him. Astonishing! He stepped back to see it better.
He advanced to look at the original, he grew excited, he gesticulated.
The man, who had never been noticed before, grew excited too.
Ernest talked the faster, gesticulated the more, until down came his
thumb on the white or the blue or the red he wanted, and, with another
sweep of his arm, a lump of it was on his palette. Farther on another
supply offered. In the end, his palette well set, he went back to his
easel, painting his copy. In some way he had supplied himself most
plentifully with "turps," so that several times the picture was in
danger of running off his canvas. At last it was finished and shown to
his patron, who refused to have it. Whistler succeeded in selling it for
Ernest to a dealer; and, "Do you know," he said, "I saw the picture
years afterwards, and I think it was rather better than the original!"
Oulevey's version is that Whistler helped himself to a box of colours,
and, when discovered by its owner, was all innocence and surprise
and apology: why, he supposed, of course, the boxes of colour were
there for the benefit of students.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when Ernest, according to Whistler, had
finished a large copy of Veronese's <i>Marriage Feast at Cana</i>, he and a
friend, carrying it between them, started out to find a buyer. They
crossed the Seine and offered it for five hundred francs to the big
dealers on the right bank. Then they offered it for two hundred and
fifty to the little dealers on the left. Then they went back and offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
it for one hundred and twenty-five. Then they came across and offered
it for seventy-five. And back again for twenty-five, and over once
more for ten. And they were crossing still again, to try to get rid of
it for five, when, on the Pont des Arts, an idea: they lifted it; "<i>Un</i>,"
they said with a great swing, "<i>deux, trois, v'lan!</i>" and over it went
into the river. There was a cry from the crowd, a rush to their side
of the bridge, <i>sergents de ville</i> came running, omnibuses and cabs
stopped on both banks, boats pushed out. It was an immense success,
and they went home enchanted.</p>

<p>Ernest was Whistler's companion in the most wonderful adventure
of all, the journey to Alsace when most of the French Set of etchings
were made. Mr. Luke Ionides thinks it was in 1856. Fantin, who
did not meet Whistler until 1858, remembered him just back from a
journey to the Rhine, coming to the <i>Café Molière</i>, and showing the
etchings made on the way. The French Set was published in November
of that year, and if Whistler returned late in the autumn, the series
could scarcely have appeared so soon. However, more important
than the date is the fact that on his journey the <i>Liverdun</i>, the <i>Street
at Saverne</i>, and <i>The Kitchen</i> were etched. He had made somehow
two hundred and fifty francs, and he and Ernest started out for Nancy
and Strasburg. Mr. Leon Dabo tells us that his father was a fellow
student of Whistler's at Gleyre's and lived at Saverne, in Alsace,
and that it was to see him Whistler went there. And from Mr. Dabo
we have the story of excursions that Whistler and Ernest made with
his father and several friends: one to the ruins of the castle near
the village of Dabo, where it is said their signatures may still be seen
on a rock of brown sandstone; another to Gross Geroldseck, and the
sketches Whistler made there were afterwards presented to the Saverne
Museum. It may be that a third excursion was to Pfalzburg, the
birthplace of Erckmann and Chatrian, whom Whistler knew and
possibly then met for the first time.</p>

<p>On the way back, at Cologne, one morning, Whistler and Ernest
woke up to find their money gone. "What is to be done?" asked
Ernest. "Order breakfast," said Whistler, which they did. There
was no American Consul in the town, and after breakfast he wrote to
everybody who might help him: to a fellow student he had asked to
forward letters from Paris, to Seymour Haden in London, to Amsterdam,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
where he thought letters might have been sent by mistake. Then
they settled down to wait. Every day they would go to the post-office
for letters, every day the official would say, "<i>Nichts! Nichts!</i>"
until they got known to the town&mdash;Whistler with his long hair, Ernest
with his brown hollands and straw hat fearfully out of season. The
boys of the town would follow to the post-office, where, before they
were at the door, the official was shaking his head and saying "<i>Nichts!
Nichts!</i>" and all the crowd would yell, "<i>Nichts! Nichts!</i>" At
last, to escape attention, they spent their days sitting on the ramparts.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight Whistler took his knapsack, put his plates
in it, and carried it to the landlord, Herr Schmitz, whose daughter,
Little Gretchen he had etched&mdash;probably the plate called <i>Gretchen
at Heidelberg</i>. He said he was penniless, but here were his copper-plates
in his knapsack upon which he would set his seal. What was
to be done with copper-plates? the landlord asked. They were
to be kept with the greatest care as the work of a distinguished artist,
Whistler answered, and when he was back in Paris, he would send the
money to pay his bill, and then the landlord would send him the knapsack.
Herr Schmitz hesitated, while Whistler and Ernest were in
despair over the necessity of trusting masterpieces to him. The bargain
was struck after much talk. The landlord gave them a last breakfast.
Lina, the maid, slipped her last groschen into Whistler's hand,
and the two set out to walk from Cologne to Paris with paper and
pencils for baggage.</p>

<p>Whistler used to say that, had they been less young, they could have
seen only the terror of that tramp. A portrait was the price of every
plate of soup, every egg, every glass of milk on the road. The children
who hooted them had to be drawn before a bit of bread was given to
them. They slept in straw. And they walked until Whistler's light
shoes got rid of most of their soles and bits of their uppers, and Ernest's
hollands grew seedier and seedier. But they were young enough to
laugh, and one day Whistler, seeing Ernest tramping ahead solemnly
through the mud, the rain dripping from his straw hat, his linen coat
a rag, shrieked with laughter as he limped. "<i>Que voulez-vous?</i>"
Ernest said mournfully, "<i>les saisons m'ont toujours devancé</i>!" But
it was the time of the autumn fairs, and, joining a lady who played
the violin and a gentleman who played the harp, they gave
entertainments in every village, beating a big drum, announcing themselves
as distinguished artists from Paris, offering to draw portraits, five
francs the full length, three francs the half-length. At times they beat
the big drum in vain, and Whistler was reduced to charging five sous
apiece for his portraits, but he did his best, he said, and there was not a
drawing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>At last they came to Aix, where there was an American Consul
who knew Major Whistler, and advanced fifty francs to his son. At
Liège, poor, shivering, ragged Ernest got twenty from the French
Consul, and the rest of the journey was made in comfort. On his
return, Whistler's first appearance at the <i>Café Molière</i> was a triumph.
They had thought him dead, and here he was, <i>le petit Américain</i>!
And what <i>blague</i>, what calling for coffee <i>pour le petit Whistler, pour
notre petit Américain</i>! And what songs!</p>

<p class="center">
"<i>Car il n'est pas mort, larifla! fla! fla!<br />
Non, c'est qu'il dort.<br />
Pour le réveiller, trinquons nos verres!<br />
Pour le réveiller, trinquons encore!</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>That Herr Schmitz was paid and delivered up the plates the prints
are the proof. Some years after Whistler went back to Cologne with
his mother. In the evening he slipped away to the old, little hotel,
where the landlord and the landlord's daughter, grown up, recognised
him and rejoiced.</p>

<p>These stories, and hundreds like them, still float about the Quarter,
told not only by Whistler, but by <i>les vieux</i>, who shake their heads
over the present degeneracy of students and the tameness of student
life&mdash;stories of the clay model of the heroic statue of Géricault, left,
for want of money, swathed in rags, and sprinkled every morning until
at last even the rags had to be sold, and then, when they were taken off,
Géricault had sprouted with mushrooms that paid for a feast in the
Quarter and enough clay to finish the statue: stories of a painter,
in his empty studio, hiring a piano by the month that the landlord
might see it carried upstairs and get a new idea of his tenant's assets;
stories of the monkey tied to a string, let loose in other people's larders,
then pulled back, clasping loaves of bread and bottles of wine to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
bosom; stories of students, with bedclothes pawned, sleeping in chests
of drawers to keep warm; stories of Courbet's <i>Baigneuse</i> in wonderful
Highland costume at the students' balls; stories of practical jokes at
the Louvre. It was the day of practical jokes, <i>les charges</i>: and
Courbet, whom they worshipped, was the biggest <i>blageur</i> of them all,
eventually signing his death-warrant with that last terrible <i>charge</i>, the
fall of the Column Vendôme, which Paris never forgave.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere, Whistler's spirit, so alarming to his mother,
found stimulus, and it is not to be wondered if his gaiety struck everyone
in Paris as in St. Petersburg and Pomfret, West Point and Washington.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII: WORKING DAYS IN THE LATIN QUARTER.<br />
THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY-FIVE TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY-NINE
CONTINUED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stories cannot be left out of Whistler's life as a student, for they
lived in his memory. The English students brought back the impression
that he was an idler, the French thought so too, and the English believe
to-day that he was an idler always. And yet he worked in Paris as
much as he played. His convictions, his preferences, his prejudices,
were formed during those years. His admiration for Poe, a West Point
man, was strengthened by the hold Poe had taken of French men of
letters. His disdain of nature, his contempt for anecdote in art as
a concession to the ignorant public, his translation of the subjects of
painting into musical terms, and much else charged against him as
deliberate pose, can be traced to Baudelaire. It is incomprehensible
how he found time to read while a student, and yet he knew the literature
of the day. With artists and their movements he was more
familiar. He mastered all that Gleyre could teach on the one hand,
Courbet on the other. He came under the influence of Lecocq de
Boisbaudran, who was occupied with the study of values, effects of
night, and training of memory. It is absurd for anyone to say that
Whistler idled away his four full years in Paris.</p>

<p>The younger men in their rebellion against official art were not
so foolish as to disdain the Old Masters. They went to the Louvre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to learn how to use their eyes and their hands. There they copied
the pictures, and there they met each other. To Whistler the Frenchmen
were more sympathetic than the English, and he joined them
at the Louvre. Respect for the great traditions of art always was
his standard: "What is not worthy of the Louvre is not art," he
said. Rembrandt, Hals, and Velasquez were the masters by whom
he was influenced. There are only a few pictures by Velasquez in the
Louvre, and Whistler's early appreciation of him has been a puzzle to
some, who, to account for it, have credited him with a journey when
a student to Madrid. But that journey was not made in the fifties
or ever, though he planned it more than once. A great deal could be
learned about Velasquez without going to Spain. Whistler knew the
London galleries, and in 1857 he visited the Art Treasures Exhibition
at Manchester, taking Henri Martin with him. There was a difficulty
about the money for their railway fares, and he suggested to T. Armstrong
that he might borrow it from a friend of the family who was
manager of the North-Western. "But have you paid him the three
hundred francs he has already lent you?" Armstrong asked. "Why,
no," Whistler answered; "ought that to make any difference?"
And he consulted the friend as to whether it would not be the right
thing to ask for another loan. From this friend, or somebody, he
managed to get the money, and Miss Emily Chapman finds in her
diaries, which she has consulted for us, that on September 11, 1857,
Rose, her sister, "went to Darwen and found Whistler and Henri
Martin staying at Earnsdale" with another sister, Mrs. Potter; "a
merry evening," the note finishes. Fourteen fine examples of Velasquez
were in the Manchester Exhibition, lent from private collections in
England, among them the <i>Venus</i>, <i>Admiral Pulido Pareja</i>, <i>Duke Olivarez
on Horseback</i>, <i>Don Balthazar in the Tennis Court</i>, some of them now in
the British National Gallery.</p>

<p>Whistler once described himself to us as "a surprising youth,
suddenly appearing in the group of French students from no one
knew where, with my <i>Mère Gérard</i> and the <i>Piano Picture</i> [<i>At the
Piano</i>] for introduction, and making friends with Fantin and Legros,
who had already arrived, and Courbet, whom they were all raving
about, and who was very kind to me."</p>

<p>The <i>Piano Picture</i> was painted toward the end of his student
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
years in Paris, the <i>Mère Gérard</i> a little earlier, so that this agrees with
Fantin's notes. In 1858, Fantin says, "I was copying the <i>Marriage
Feast at Cana</i> in the Louvre when I saw passing one day a strange
creature&mdash;<i>personnage étrange, le Whistler en chapeau bizarre</i>, who,
amiable and charming, stopped to talk, and the talk was the beginning
of our friendship, strengthened that evening at the <i>Café
Molière</i>."</p>

<p>Carolus Duran writes us, from the Académie de France in Rome,
that he and Whistler met as students in Paris; after that he lost sight
of Whistler until the days of the new <i>Salon</i>, but, though there were
a few meetings then, his memories are altogether of the student years.
Bracquemond has recalled for us that he was making the preliminary
drawing for his etching after Holbein's <i>Erasmus</i> in the Louvre when
he first saw Whistler. Their meetings were cordial, but never led
to intimacy. With Legros Whistler's friendship did become intimate,
and the two, with Fantin, formed at that date what Whistler called
their "Society of Three."</p>

<p>Fantin was somewhat older, and had been studying much longer,
and had, among students, a reputation for wide and sound knowledge:
"a learned painter," Armstrong says. M. Bénédite thinks that the
friendship was useful to Fantin, but of the greatest importance to
Whistler, on whose art in its development it had a marked influence.
Mr. Luke Ionides, on the other hand, insists that "even in those
early days, Whistler's influence was very much felt. He had decided
views, which were always listened to with respect and regard by many
older artists, who seemed to recognise his genius." The truth probably
is that Whistler and Fantin influenced each other. They worked in
sympathy, and the understanding between them was complete. They
not only studied in the Louvre, but joined the group at Bonvin's
studio to work from the model under Courbet.</p>

<p>With Courbet, we come to an influence which cannot be doubted,
much as Whistler regretted it as time went on. Oulevey remembers
Whistler calling on Courbet once, and saying enthusiastically as he left
the house, "<i>C'est un grand homme!</i>" and for several years his pictures
showed how strong this influence was. M. Duret even sees in Courbet's
"Manifestoes" forerunners of Whistler's letters at a later date to the
papers. Courbet, whatever mad pranks he might play with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<i>bourgeois</i>, was seriousness itself in his art, and the men who studied
under him learned to be serious, Whistler most of all.</p>

<p>The proof of Whistler's industry is in his work&mdash;in his pictures
and prints, which are amazing in quality and quantity for the student
who, Sir Edward Poynter believes, worked in two or three years only
as many weeks. It would be nearer the truth to say that he never
stopped working. Everything that interested him he made use of.
The women he danced with at night were his models by day: Fumette,
who, as she crouches, her hair loose on her shoulders, in that early
etching, looks the <i>Tigresse</i> who tore up his drawings in a passion; and
Finette, the dancer in a famous quadrille, who, when she came to
London, was announced as "<i>Madame Finette in the cancan, the national
dance of France</i>." His friends had to pose for him: Drouet, in the
plate, done, he told us, in two sittings, one of two and a half hours,
the other of an hour and a half; Axenfeld, the brother of a famous
physician; Becquet, the sculptor-musician, "the greatest man who
ever lived" to his friends, to the world unknown; Astruc, painter,
sculptor, poet, editor of <i>L'Artiste</i>, of whom his wife said that he was
the first man since the Renaissance who combined all the arts, but who
is only remembered in Whistler's print; Delâtre, the printer; Riault,
the engraver. Bibi Valentin was the son of another engraver. And
there is the amusing pencil sketch of Fantin in bed on a winter day,
working away in his overcoat, muffler, and top hat, trying to keep
warm: one kept among a hundred lost. The streets where Whistler
wandered, the restaurants where he dined, became his studios. At the
house near the Rue Dauphine he etched Bibi Lalouette. His <i>Soupe à
Trois Sous</i> was done in a <i>cabaret</i> kept by Martin, whose portrait is in
the print at the extreme left, and who was famous in the Quarter for
having won the Cross of the Legion of Honour at an earlier age than
any man ever decorated, and then promptly losing it. Mr. Ralph
Thomas says: "While Whistler was etching this, at twelve o'clock at
night, a <i>gendarme</i> came up to him and wanted to know what he was
doing. Whistler gave him the plate upside down, but officialism could
make nothing of it."</p>

<p>There is hardly one of these etchings that is not a record of his daily
life and of the people among whom he lived, though to make it such
a record was the last thing he was thinking of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Whistler's first set of etchings was published in November 1858.
The prints were not the first he made after leaving Washington. On
the rare <i>Au Sixième</i>, supposed to be unique, Haden, to whom it had
belonged, wrote, "Probably the first of Whistler's etchings," but then
Haden wrote these things on others, and knew little about them. A
portrait of himself, another of his niece <i>Annie Haden</i>, the <i>Dutchman
holding the Glass</i>, are as early, if not earlier. There were twelve plates,
some done in Paris, some during the journey to the Rhine, some
in London. There was also an etched title with his portrait, for
which Ernest, putting on the big hat, sat. Etched above is "<i>Douze
Eaux Fortes d'après Nature par James Whistler</i>," and to one side,
"<i>Imp. Delâtre, Rue St. Jacques, 171, Paris, Nov. 1858</i>." Whistler
dedicated the set to <i>mon vieil ami Seymour Haden</i>, and issued and
sold it himself for two guineas. Delâtre printed the plates, and,
standing at his side, Drouet said, Whistler learned the art. Delâtre's
shop was the room described by the De Goncourts, with the two
windows looking on a bare garden, the star wheel, the man in grey
blouse pulling it, the old noisy clock in the corner, the sleeping dog,
the children peeping in at the door; the room where they waited for
their first proof with the emotion they thought nothing else could give.
Drouet said that Whistler never printed at this time. But Oulevey
remembers a little press in the Rue Campagne-Première, and Whistler
pulling the proofs for those who came to buy them. He was already
hunting for old paper, loitering at the boxes along the <i>quais</i>, tearing out
fly-leaves from old books. Passages in many plates of the series,
especially in <i>La Mère Gérard</i> and <i>La Marchande de Moutarde</i>, are, as
we have said, like his work in <i>The Coast Survey, No. 1</i>. For the only
time, and as a result of his training at Washington, his handling
threatened to become mannered. But in the <i>Street at Saverne</i> he overcame
his mannerism, while in others, not in the series but done during
these years, the <i>Drouet</i>, <i>Soupe à Trois Sous</i>, <i>Bibi Lalouette</i>, he had
perfected his early style of drawing, biting, and dry-point. We never
asked him how the French plates were bitten, but, no doubt, it was in
the traditional way by biting all over and stopping out. They were
drawn directly from Nature, as can be seen in his portraits of places
which are reversed in the prints. So far as we know, he scarcely ever
made a preliminary sketch. We can recall none of his etchings at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
period that might have been done from memory or sketches, except
the <i>Street at Saverne</i>, the Venetian <i>Nocturnes</i>, the <i>Nocturne</i>, <i>Dance
House</i>, Amsterdam, <i>Weary</i>, and <i>Fanny Leyland</i> portraits.</p>

<p>His first commissions in Paris were, he told us, copies made in
the Louvre. They were for Captain Williams, a Stonington man,
familiarly known as "Stonington Bill," whose portrait he had painted
before leaving home. "Stonington Bill" must have liked it, for
when he came to Paris shortly afterwards he gave Whistler a commission
to paint as many copies at the Louvre as he chose for twenty-five
dollars apiece. Whistler said he copied a snow scene with a
horse and soldier standing by and another at its feet, and never afterwards
could remember who was the painter; the busy picture detective
may run it to ground for the edification of posterity. There
was a St. Luke with a halo and draperies; a woman holding up a
child towards a barred window beyond which, seen dimly, was the
face of a man; and an inundation, no doubt <i>The Deluge</i> or <i>The Wreck</i>.
He was sure he must have made something interesting out of them,
he knew there were wonderful things even then&mdash;the beginnings of
harmonies and of purple schemes&mdash;he supposed it must have been
intuitive. Another Stonington man commissioned him to paint Ingres'
<i>Andromeda</i> chained to the rock&mdash;probably the <i>Angelina</i> of Ingres
which he and Tissot are said to have copied side by side, though a
copy of an <i>Andromeda</i> by him has been shown in New York, and other
alleged copies are now turning up. All, he said, might be still at
Stonington, and shown there as marvellous things by Whistler. To
these may be added the <i>Diana</i> by Boucher in the London Memorial
Exhibition, owned by Mr. Louis Winans, and the group of cavaliers
after Velasquez, the one copy Fantin remembered his doing. A
study of a nun was sent to the London Exhibition, but not shown,
with the name "Wisler" on the back of the canvas, not a bad study
of drapery, which may have been, despite the name, another of his
copies or done in a sketch class.</p>

<p>The first original picture in Paris was, he assured us, the <i>Mère
Gérard</i>, in white cap, holding a flower, which he gave to Swinburne.
There is another painting of her, we believe, and from Drouet we heard
of a third, which has vanished. Whistler painted a number of portraits;
some it would probably be impossible to trace, a few are well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
known. One&mdash;a difficult piece of work, he said&mdash;was of his father, after
a lithograph sent him for the purpose by his brother George, and he
began another of Henry Harrison, whom he had known in Russia. A
third was of himself in his big hat. Two were studies of models: the
<i>Tête de Paysanne</i>, a woman in a white cap, younger than the <i>Mère
Gérard</i>, and the <i>Head of an Old Man Smoking</i>, a pedlar of crockery
whom Whistler came across one day in the Halles, a full face with large
brown hat, for long the property of Drouet and left by him to the
Louvre. But the finest is <i>At the Piano</i>, <i>The Piano Picture</i> as Whistler
called it. It is the portrait of his sister and his niece, the "wonderful
little Annie" of the etchings, now Mrs. Charles Thynne, who gave him
many sittings, and to whom, in return, he gave his pencil sketches made
on the journey to Alsace.</p>

<p>Mr. Gallatin, in <i>Portraits of Whistler</i>, and M. Duret, in the second
edition of <i>Whistler</i>, have reproduced an oil portrait entitled <i>Whistler
Smoking</i>, which was bought from a French family in 1913. The most
cursory glance at even the reproduction is enough to show that the
portrait is devoid of merit, while the statement that it was hidden from
1860 to 1913 would require considerable further proof. The whole
thing is but a clumsy attempt to imitate the <i>Whistler in the Big Hat</i>,
as well as the etching of the same subject. Every part of it is stolen
from some other work, down to the hand or handkerchief, just indicated,
which is taken from the portrait of his mother. It is true that
the signature is on the painting, but this no longer proves anything,
as a signature is the easiest part of a work of art to forge.</p>

<p>The portraits "smell of the Louvre." The method is acquired
from close study of the Old Masters. "Rembrandtish" is the usual
criticism passed on these early canvases, with their paint laid thickly
on and their heavy shadows. Indeed, it is evident that his own
portrait, <i>Whistler in the Big Hat</i>, was suggested by Rembrandt's
<i>Young Man</i> in the Louvre. To his choice of subjects, in his pictures
as in his etchings, he brought the realism of Courbet, painting people
as he saw them, and not in clothes borrowed from the classical and
mediæval wardrobes of the fashionable studio. Yet there is the
personal note: Whistler does not efface himself in his devotion to
the masters. This is felt in the way a head or a figure is placed on
the canvas. The arrangement of the pictures on the wall and the
mouldings of the dado in <i>At the Piano</i>, the harmonious balance of the
black and white in the dresses of the mother and the little girl, show
the sense of design, of pattern, which he brought to perfection in
the <i>Mother</i>, <i>Carlyle</i>, and <i>Miss Alexander</i>. There was nothing like it
in the painting of the other young men, of Degas, Fantin, Legros,
Ribot, Manet; nothing like it in the work of the older man, their
leader, when painting <i>L'Enterrement à Ornans</i> and <i>Bonjour, Monsieur
Courbet</i>. M. Duret says that Whistler's fellow students, who had
immediately recognised his etchings, now accepted his paintings, which
confirms Whistler's statement to us.</p>

<p><i>At the Piano</i> was sent to the <i>Salon</i> of 1859 with two etchings the
titles of which are not given. The etchings were hung, the picture
was rejected. It may have been because of what was personal in it;
strong personality in the young usually fares that way at official hands.
Fantin's story is:</p>

<p>"One day Whistler brought back from London the <i>Piano Picture</i>,
representing his sister and niece. He was refused with Legros, Ribot,
and myself at the <i>Salon</i>. Bonvin, whom I knew, interested himself
in our rejected pictures, and exhibited them in his studio, and invited
his friends, of whom Courbet was one, to see them. I recall very well
that Courbet was struck with Whistler's picture."</p>

<p>Two portraits by Fantin, some studies of still life by Ribot, and
Legros' portrait of his father, which had also been rejected, were
shown. The rejection was a scandal. The injustice was flagrant, the
exhibitors at Bonvin's found themselves famous, and Whistler's picture
impressed many artists besides Courbet. With its exhibition Whistler
ceased to be the student, though he was a student all his life; it was
only in his last years that he felt he was "beginning to understand,"
he often said to us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII: THE BEGINNINGS IN LONDON.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN FIFTY-NINE TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY-THREE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now that Whistler began his endless journeys between Paris
and London. At first he stayed with his sister, Lady Haden, at
62 Sloane Street, sometimes bringing with him Henri Martin or Legros.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
In 1859 he invited Fantin, promising him glory and fortune. In
his notes Fantin wrote:</p>

<p>"Whistler talked about me at this moment to his brother-in-law,
Seymour Haden, who urged me to come to London; he had also
talked about me to Boxall. I should like it known that it was Whistler
who introduced me to England."</p>

<p>Fantin arrived in time for them to go to the Academy, then still
in the east end of the National Gallery. Whistler exhibited for the
first time, and <i>Two Etchings from Nature</i>&mdash;a perplexing title, for all
his etchings were "from Nature"&mdash;were hung in the little octagon
room, or "dark cell," reserved for black-and-white. "<i>Les souvenirs
les plus vifs que j'ai conservés de ce temps à Londres</i>," Fantin wrote
"<i>étaient notre admiration pour l'exposition des tableaux de Millais
à l'Academy</i>." Millais showed <i>The Vale of Rest</i>, and the two young
men, fresh from Paris studios, recognised in his work the realism
which, though conceived and expressed so differently, was the aim of
the Pre-Raphaelites as of Courbet.</p>

<p>Seymour Haden, who had already etched some of his finest plates,
was kind to his visitors. He not only ordered copies from Fantin&mdash;amongst
them one of the many Fantin made of Veronese's <i>Marriage
Feast at Cana</i>&mdash;but he bought the pictures of Legros, who was "at
one moment in so deplorable a condition," Whistler said to us, "that
it needed God or a lesser person to pull him out of it. And so I brought
him over to London, and for a while he worked in my studio. He
had, before coming, sold a church interior to Haden, who liked it,
though he found the floor out of perspective. One day he took it
to the room upstairs where he did his etchings, and turned the key.
When it reappeared the floor was in perspective according to Haden.
A gorgeous frame was bought, and the picture was hung conspicuously
in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>Whistler thought Haden restive when he heard that Legros was
coming, but nothing was said. The first day Legros was impressed;
he had been accustomed to seeing himself in cheap frames, if in any
frame at all. But gradually he looked inside the frame, and Haden's
work dawned upon him. That he could not stand. What was he
to do? he asked Whistler. "Run off with it," Whistler suggested.
"We got it down, called a four-wheeler, and carried it away to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
studio&mdash;our own little <i>kopje</i>," for Whistler told us the story in the days
of the Boer War. Haden discovered his loss as soon as he got home,
and in a rage hurried after them to the studio. But when he saw
it on an easel, Legros repainting the perspective according to his
idea, well, there was nothing to say. Where the studio was we do
not know.</p>

<p>Haden even endured Ernest, who had not yet caught up with the
seasons, and who went about in terror of the butler, taking his daily
walks in slippers rather than expose his boots to the servants, and
enchanting Whistler by asking "<i>Mais, mon cher, qu'est-ce que c'est que
cette espèce de cataracte de Niagara?</i>" when Haden turned on the
shower-bath in the morning. Fantin was almost as dismayed by the
luxury at the Hadens'. "What lunches!" he wrote home, "what
roast beef and sherry! And what dinners&mdash;always champagne!"
And if he was distressed by the street organs grinding out the <i>Miséréré</i>
of Verdi, he could console himself by listening to Lady Haden's brilliant
playing on the piano, until <i>paradisiaque</i> was the adjective he found to
describe his life there to his parents.</p>

<p>Whistler fell in at once with the English students whom he had
known in Paris: Poynter, Armstrong, Luke and Aleco Ionides. Du
Maurier came back from Antwerp in 1860, and for several months he
and Whistler lived together in Newman Street. Armstrong remembers
their studio, with a rope like a clothes-line stretched across it and,
floating from it, a bit of brocade no bigger than a handkerchief, which
was their curtain to shut off the corner used as a bedroom. There was
hardly ever a chair to sit on, and often with the brocade a towel hung
from the line: their decoration and drapery. Du Maurier's first <i>Punch</i>
drawing&mdash;in a volume full of crinolines and Leech (vol. <span class="smcap">XXXIX.</span>,
October 6, 1860)&mdash;shows the two, shabby, smoking, calling at a photographer's
to be met with an indignant, "No smoking here, sirs!"
followed by a severe, "Please to remember, gentlemen, that this
is not a common Hartist's Studio!" The figure at the door, with
curly hair, top hat, glass in his eye, hands behind his back smoking
a cigarette, is Whistler. Probably it was then also that Du Maurier
made a little drawing, in Mr. Howard Mansfield's collection, of Whistler,
Charles Keene, and himself, with their autographs below; Whistler
again with a glass in his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nearly always, on Sunday, he used to come to our house,"
Mr. Ionides tells us, and there was no more delightful house in London.
Alexander Ionides, the father, was a wealthy merchant with a talent
for gathering about him all the interesting people in town or passing
through, artists, musicians, actors, authors. Mr. Luke Ionides says
that Whistler came to their evenings and played in their private
theatricals, and there remains a programme designed by Du Maurier
with a drawing of himself, Whistler, and Aleco Ionides at the top,
while Luke Ionides and his sister, Mrs. Coronio, stand below with the
list of <i>dramatis personæ</i> between. And Whistler also took part in
their masquerades and fancy-dress balls, once mystifying everybody
by appearing in two different costumes in the course of the evening
and winding up as a sweep. He never lost his joy in the memory of
Alma-Tadema, on another of these occasions, as an "Ancient Roman"
in toga and eye-glasses, crowned with flowers: "amazing," Whistler
said, "with his bare feet and Romano-Greek St. John's Wooden
eye!"</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Severn writes us: "My first recollection of Whistler
was at his brother-in-law's, Seymour Haden (he and Du Maurier
were looking over some <i>Liber Studiorum</i> engravings), and then at
Arthur Lewis' parties on Campden Hill, charming gatherings of talented
men of all kinds, with plenty of listeners and sympathisers to applaud.
The Moray Minstrels used to sing, conducted by John Foster, and
when they were resting anyone who could do anything was put up.
Du Maurier with Harold Sower would sing a duet, <i>Les Deux Aveugles</i>;
Grossmith half killed us with laughter (it was at these parties he first
came out). Stacy Marks was a great attraction, but towards the end
of the evening, when we were all in accord, there were yells for Whistler,
the eccentric Whistler! He was seized and stood up on a high stool,
where he assumed the most irresistibly comic look, put his glass in
his eye, and surveyed the multitude, who only yelled the more. When
silence reigned he would begin to sing in the most curious way, suiting
the action to the words with his small, thin, sensitive hands. His
songs were in <i>argot</i> French, imitations of what he had heard in low
<i>cabarets</i> on the Seine when he was at work there. What Whistler and
Marks did was so entirely themselves and nobody else, so original or
quaint, that they were certainly the favourites."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>"Breezy, buoyant and debonair, sunny and affectionate," he
seemed to George Boughton, who could not remember the time when
"Whistler's sayings and doings did not fill the artistic air," nor when
he failed to give a personal touch, a "something distinct" to his
appearance. His "cool suit of linen duck and his jaunty straw hat"
were conspicuous in London, where personality of dress was more
startling than in Paris. Boughton refers to a flying trip to Paris at
this period, when he was "flush of money and lovely in attire." Others
recall meeting him, armed with two umbrellas, a white and a black,
his practical preparation for all weathers. Val Prinsep speaks of
the pink silk handkerchief stuck in his waistcoat, but this must have
been later. "A brisk little man, conspicuous from his swarthy complexion,
his gleaming eye-glass, and his shock of curly black hair, amid
which shone his celebrated white lock," is Val Prinsep's description
of him in the fifties.</p>

<p>But the white lock is not seen in any contemporary painting or
etching. It was first introduced, as far as we can discover, in his
portrait owned by the late Mr. McCulloch&mdash;the portrait a few years
ago was in Detroit&mdash;and in the etching <i>Whistler with the White Lock</i>,
1879, though there may be earlier work showing it. We never asked
him about it, and his family, friends, and contemporaries, whom we
have asked, cannot explain it. Some say that it was a birthmark,
others that he dyed all his hair save the one lock. But he did not
dye his hair. Du Maurier, according to Dr. Williamson, attributed
it to a wound, either by bullet or sword-cut, received at Valparaiso:
the wound was sewn up, the white lock appeared almost immediately.
Mr. Theodore Roussel tells a somewhat similar story. But we think
if this were so, Whistler would have told us of it. In an exhibition
of oil paintings and pastels by Whistler held in the Metropolitan
Museum, New York, in March 1910, a painting was shown entitled
<i>Sketch of Mr. Whistler</i>. It was lent by Mr. Charles L. Freer and
was sold to him by an art dealer. We are by no means certain that
it is genuine, though we have only seen the reproduction, the frontispiece
of the catalogue. J. recently went to Detroit, but in Mr. Freer's
absence he was not allowed to see the painting. If it is genuine,
it is most likely a study by Whistler of the Chinese dress in which
he posed for Fantin. In Freer's sketch the white lock appears. Though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
it could easily have been added later, its presence to us seems proof
that the picture is most probably not genuine, and certainly is not
contemporary, because in Fantin's head of Whistler from the <i>Toast</i>,
in <i>Hommage à Delacroix</i>, and Whistler's own portraits of that time
the white lock is not shown. Many, seeing him for the first time,
mistook the white lock for a floating feather. He used to call it the
<i>Mèche de Silas</i>, and it amused him to explain that the Devil caught
those whom he would preserve by a lock of hair which turned white.
Whatever its origin, Whistler cherished it with greatest care.</p>

<p>Whistler had stumbled upon a period in England when, though
painters prospered, art was at a low ebb. Pre-Raphaelitism was on
the wane. A few interesting young men were at work: Charles
Keene, Boyd Houghton, Albert Moore; Fred Walker and George
Mason. But Academicians were at the high tide of mid-Victorian
success and sentiment. They puzzled Whistler no less than he puzzled
them.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, it was this way. When I came to London
I was received graciously by the painters. Then there was coldness,
and I could not understand. Artists locked themselves up in their
studios&mdash;opened the doors only on the chain; if they met each other
in the street they barely spoke. Models went round with an air of
mystery. When I asked one where she had been posing, she said,
'To Frith and Watts and Tadema.' 'Golly! what a crew!' I said.
'And that's just what they says when I told 'em I was a-posing to
you!' Then I found out the mystery; it was the moment of painting
the Royal Academy picture. Each man was afraid his subject might
be stolen. It was the era of the subject. And, at last, on Varnishing
Day, there was the subject in all its glory&mdash;wonderful! The British
subject! Like a flash the inspiration came&mdash;the Inventor! And in
the Academy there you saw him: the familiar model&mdash;the soldier
or the Italian&mdash;and there he sat, hands on knees, head bent, brows
knit, eyes staring; in a corner, angels and cogwheels and things;
close to him his wife, cold, ragged, the baby in her arms; he had
failed! The story was told; it was clear as day&mdash;amazing! The
British subject! What."</p>

<p>Into this riot of subject, to the Academy of 1860, <i>At the Piano</i>
was sent, with five prints: <i>Monsieur Astruc, Rédacteur du Journal
</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<i>'L'Artiste,'</i> portrait, and three of the Thames Set.
Whistler had given <i>At the Piano</i>, the portrait of his sister and niece,
to Seymour Haden, "in a way," he said:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, it was hanging there, but I had no particular
satisfaction in that. Haden just then was playing the authority on
art, and he could never look at it without pointing out its faults and
telling me it never would get into the Academy&mdash;that was certain."</p>

<p>However, at the Academy it was accepted, Whistler's first picture
in an English exhibition. The <i>Salon</i> was not held then every year,
and he could not hope to repeat his success in Paris. But in London
<i>At the Piano</i> was as much talked about as at Bonvin's. It was bought
by John Phillip, the Academician (no relation to the family into
which Whistler afterwards married). Phillip had just returned from
Spain with, "well, you know, Spanish notions about things, and he
asked who had painted the picture, and they told him a youth no one
knew about, who had appeared from no one knew where. Phillip
looked up my address in the catalogue and wrote to me at once to say
he would like to buy it, and what was its price? I answered in a letter
which, I am sure, must have been very beautiful. I said that, in my
youth and inexperience, I did not know about these things, and I would
leave to him the question of price. Phillip sent me thirty pounds;
when the picture was last sold, to Edmund Davis, it brought two
thousand eight hundred!"</p>

<p>Thackeray, Lady Ritchie tells us, "went to see the picture of Annie
Haden standing by the piano, and admired it beyond words, and stood
looking at it with real delight and appreciation." It was the only
thing George Boughton brought vividly away in his memories of
the Academy. The critics could not ignore it. "It at once made
an impression," Mr. W. M. Rossetti wrote. As "an eccentric, uncouth,
smudgy, phantom-like picture of a lady at a pianoforte, with a ghostly-looking
child in a white frock looking on," it struck the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.
But the <i>Athenæum</i>, having discovered the "admirable etchings" in
the octagon room, managed to see in the "<i>Piano Picture</i>, despite a
recklessly bold manner and sketchiness of the wildest and roughest
kind, a genuine feeling for colour and a splendid power of composition
and design, which evince a just appreciation of nature very rare among
artists. If the observer will look for a little while at this singular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
production, he will perceive that it 'opens out' just as a stereoscopic
view will&mdash;an excellent quality due to the artist's feeling for atmosphere
and judicious gradation of light."</p>

<p>We quote these criticisms because the general idea is that Whistler
waited long for notice. He was always noticed, praised or blamed,
never ignored, after 1859.</p>

<p>Whistler went back to Paris late in that year. December 1859 is
the date of his <i>Isle de la Cité</i>, etched from the Galerie d'Apollon in
the Louvre, with Notre Dame in the distance and the Seine and its
bridges between. It was his only attempt to rival Méryon, and he
succeeded badly. The fact that he gave it up when half done shows
that he thought so and was too big an artist to be an imitator, especially
of a "little man like Méryon." Besides, he was much less in Paris now,
for, though he preferred life there, he found his subjects in London,
which he soon made his home, as it continued to be, except for a few
intervals, until his death. It was not the people he cared for, nor the
customs. He was drawn by the beauty that no one had felt with the
same intensity and understanding.</p>

<p>He went to work on the river. In these first years he dated his
prints and pictures, as he seldom did later, and 1859 is bitten on
many of the Thames plates. He saw the river as no one had seen it
before, in its grime and glitter, with its forest of shipping, its endless
procession of barges, its grim warehouses, its huge docks, its little
water-side inns. And as he saw it so he rendered it, as no one ever had
before&mdash;as it is. It was left to the American youth to do for London
what Rembrandt had done for Amsterdam. There were eleven plates
on the Thames during this year. To make them he wandered from
Greenwich to Westminster; they included <i>Black Lion Wharf</i>, <i>Tyzac</i>,
<i>Whiteley and Co.</i>, which he never excelled at any period; and in
each the warehouses or bridges, the docks or ships, are worked out
with a mass and marvel of detail. The Pre-Raphaelites were not so
faithful to Nature, so minute in their rendering. The series was
a wonderful achievement for the young man of twenty-five never
known to work by his English fellow students, a wonderful achievement
for an artist of any age.</p>

<p>Those who thought he idled in Paris were as sure of his application
in London. "On the Thames he worked tremendously," Armstrong
said, "not caring then to have people about or to let anyone see too
much of his methods." He stayed for months at Wapping to be
near his subjects, though not cutting himself off entirely from his
friends. Sir Edward Poynter, Mr. Ionides, M. Legros, Du Maurier
visited him. Mr. Ionides recalls long drives down by the Tower and
the London Docks to get to the place, as out of the way now as then.
He says Whistler lived in a little inn, rather rough, frequented by
skippers and bargees, close to Wapping steamboat pier. But there
is no doubt that much of his work was done from Cherry Gardens,
on the other side of the river. Unfortunately it was not until after
his death that we looked into this matter. At any rate, if he lived
at Wapping, he worked a great deal at Cherry Gardens, also often from
boats and barges, he told us, and this one can see in the prints. Sometimes
he would get stranded in the mud, and at others cut off by
the tide. "When his friends came," Armstrong wrote us, "they
dined at an <i>ordinary</i> there used to be. People who had business at
the wharves in the neighbourhood dined there, and Jimmie's descriptions
of the company were always humorous." Mr. Ionides drove
down once for a dinner-party Whistler gave at his inn:</p>

<p>"The landlord and several bargee guests were invited. Du Maurier
was there also, and after dinner we had songs and sentiments. Jimmie
proposed the landlord's health; he felt flattered, but we were in fits
of laughter. The landlord was very jealous of his wife, who was
rather inclined to flirt with Jimmie, and the whole speech was chaff
of a soothing kind that he never suspected."</p>

<p>Another and more frequent visitor to Wapping was Serjeant
Thomas, one of those patrons who recognise the young artist and
appear when recognition is most needed. He bought drawings and
prints from Holman Hunt and Legros when they were scarcely known,
and he helped Millais through difficult days. Whistler had issued
his French Set of etchings in London in 1859: <i>Twelve Etchings from
Nature by James Abbott Whistler, London</i>. <i>Published by J. A. Whistler,
At No. 62 Sloane Street</i> (Haden's house). The price, as in Paris, for
<i>Artist's Proofs on India, two guineas</i>. Serjeant Thomas saw the prints,
got to know Whistler, and arranged to publish them, and also the
Thames etchings which he sold separately at 39 Old Bond Street,
where he had opened a shop with his son, Edmund Thomas, as manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Percy Thomas, a younger son, has told us that, as a little fellow,
he often went with his father by boat to Wapping, and that his father
and brother posed for two of the figures&mdash;the third is Whistler&mdash;in
<i>The Little Pool</i>, used as an invitation card. He has also told us that
much of the printing was done at 39 Old Bond Street, where the family
lived in the upper part of the house. A press was in one of the small
rooms, and Whistler would come in the evening, when he happened to
be in town, to bite and prove his plates. Sometimes he would not
get to work until half-past ten or eleven. In those days he put his
plate in a deep bath of acid, keeping to the technical methods of the
Coast Survey, though it is said that the Coast Survey plates were banked
up with wax and the acid poured over them. This is supposed to have
been the method of Rembrandt. Serjeant Thomas, in his son's words,
was "great for port wine," and he would fill a glass for Whistler, and
Whistler would place the glass by the bath, and then work a little on
the plate and then stop to sip the port, and he would say, "Excellent!
Very good indeed!" and they never knew whether he meant the wine
or the work. And the charm of his manner and his courtesy made it
delightful to do anything for him. Serjeant Thomas brought Delâtre
from Paris, the only man, he thought, who could print Whistler's
etchings as the artist would have printed them himself. "Nobody,"
Ralph Thomas wrote, "has ever printed Mr. Whistler's etchings with
success except himself and M. Delâtre," and to-day many people are
of the same opinion. Whistler's relations with the firm were pleasant
while they lasted. But they did not last long. Edmund Thomas
cared less for art than the law, and in the shop he would sit at his desk
reading his law books, never looking up nor leaving them, unless someone
asked the price of a print or drawing. A successful business is not
run on those lines, and in a few years he gave up art for the law, to his
great advantage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX: THE BEGINNINGS IN LONDON.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN FIFTY-NINE TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY-THREE
CONTINUED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span>, in 1860, devoted more time to painting on the river and
less to etching, though the <i>Rotherhithe</i> belongs to this year. One
picture he described in a letter to Fantin. "<i>Chut! n'en parle pas à
Courbet</i>" was his warning, as if afraid to trust so good a subject to anyone.
It was to be a masterpiece, he had painted it three times, and he
sent a sketch which M. Duret reproduced in his <i>Whistler</i>. M. Duret,
unable to trace the picture, thought he might never have carried it
beyond the sketch. But it was finished: the <i>Wapping</i> shown in the
Academy of 1864, a proof how long Whistler kept his pictures before
exhibiting them. In 1867 he sent it to the Paris Exhibition. It was
bought by Mr. Thomas Winans, taken to Baltimore, where it has remained.
Whistler wanted to exhibit it at Goupil's in 1892, but could
not get it. Never seen in Europe since 1867, it has been forgotten.
It was painted from an inn, probably The Angel on the water-side at
Cherry Gardens which exists to-day, one of a row of old houses with
overhanging balconies. In the foreground, in a shadowy corner of the
inn balcony, is a sailor for whom a workman from Greaves' boat-building
yard, Chelsea, sat; next, M. Legros; and on the other side
of M. Legros, with her back turned to the river, the girl with copper-coloured
hair, Jo, the model for <i>The White Girl</i> and <i>The Little White
Girl</i>. On the river are the little square-rigged ships that still anchor
there; on the opposite side is the long line of Wapping warehouses,
which give the name. Artists feared Jo's slightly open bodice would
prevent the picture being hung in the Royal Academy. But Whistler
insisted, if it was rejected on that account, he would open the bodice
more and more every year until he was elected and hung it himself.</p>

<p>He painted <i>The Thames in Ice</i> this year (1860) from the same inn.
It was called, when first exhibited, <i>The Twenty-fifth of December, 1860,
on the Thames</i>. For an idle apprentice it was a strange way of spending
Christmas. Whistler told us that Haden bought it for ten pounds&mdash;ample
pay, Haden said: three pounds for each of the three days
he spent painting it, and a pound over. To Whistler the pay seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
anything but ample. "You know, my sister was in the house, and
women have their ideas about things, and I did what she wanted,
to please her!"</p>

<p>Two other pictures of 1860 are the portrait of Mr. Luke Ionides
and <i>The Music Room</i>. In both the influence of Courbet is evident.
The portrait, painted in the Newman Street studio, has the heavy
handling of <i>The Piano</i>, though much more brilliant. But the other
picture is a tremendous advance.</p>

<p>Fantin could not have been more conscientious in rendering the
life about him as he found it than Whistler in <i>The Music Room</i>; only,
the room in the London house, with its gay chintz curtains, has none
of the sombre simplicity of the interior where Fantin's sisters sit.
Fantin's home had an austerity he made beautiful; the Haden's house
had colour&mdash;<i>Harmony in Green and Rose</i> was Whistler's later title for
the picture. He emphasised the gaiety by introducing a strong black
note in the standing figure, Miss Boot, while the cool light from the
window falls on "wonderful little Annie," in the same white frock
she wears in <i>The Piano Picture</i>. Mrs. Thynne (Annie Haden) says:</p>

<p>"I was very young when <i>The Music Room</i> was painted, and beyond
the fact of not minding sitting, in spite of the interminable length of
time, I do not know that I can say more. It was a distinctly amusing
time for me. He was always so delightful and enjoyed the 'no lessons'
as much as I did. One day in <i>The Morning Call</i> (the first name of
<i>The Music Room</i>) I did get tired without knowing it, and suddenly
dissolved into tears, whereupon he was full of the most tender remorse,
and rushed out and bought me a lovely Russia leather writing set,
which I am using at this very moment! The actual music-room still
exists in Sloane Street, though the present owners have enlarged it,
and the date of the picture must have been '60 or '61, after his return
from Paris. It was then he gave me the pencil sketches I lent to the
London Memorial Exhibition. I had kept them in an album he had
also brought me from Paris, with my name in gold stamped outside,
of which I was very proud. We were always good friends, and I have
nothing all through those early days but the most delightful remembrance
of him."</p>

<p>This picture is described under three titles: <i>The Morning Call</i>, <i>The
Music Room</i>, and <i>Harmony in Green and Rose, The Music Room</i>; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
present confusion in Whistler's titles is usually the result of his own
vagueness. It became the property of Mrs. Réveillon, George Whistler's
daughter, and was carried off to St. Petersburg, never to return to
London until the exhibition at the Goupil Gallery in 1892.</p>

<p>It has become the fashion to say that Whistler had not mastered
his trade and could not use oil paint. These early pictures are technically
as accomplished as the work of any of his contemporaries. He
never was taught, few artists are, the elements of his trade, and some
of his paintings have suffered. <i>The Music Room</i> and <i>The Thames in Ice</i>,
so far as we can remember, are wonderfully fresh. They were painted
more directly, more thinly, than the <i>Wapping</i>, in which the paint
is thickly piled, as in the <i>Piano Picture</i>, which has cracked, no doubt
the result of his working over it probably on a bad ground. Of two
pictures painted at the same period, the <i>Wapping</i> is badly cracked, and
the <i>Thames in Ice</i> is in perfect condition. But this is due to his want
of knowledge of the chemical properties of paints and mediums. Later,
he gave great attention to these matters. He kept the <i>Wapping</i> four
years before he showed it. Though started down the river in 1860, it
contains a portrait of Greaves' man, whom he did not see for two or
three years after. Walter Greaves stated, or allowed to be stated, in
a preface to the catalogue of his exhibition in May 1911, that he met
Whistler in the late fifties when Whistler lived in Chelsea and made
the Thames series of etchings. But the statement was proved to be
inaccurate, and the preface was withdrawn. We have quoted Greaves
on several occasions, but, before doing so, we have verified every statement
of importance he made to us, and we first met him some few years
ago when his memory was clearer and more reliable, and when he
possessed letters from Whistler which we have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Thynne stood in 1860 for the beautiful dry-point <i>Annie Haden</i>,
in big crinoline and soup-plate hat, the print Whistler told Mr. E. G.
Kennedy he would choose by which to be remembered. It was the
year also of the portraits of Axenfeld, Riault, and "Mr. Mann." In
1861 there were more plates on the Upper as well as the Lower Thames.
Two of the plates of 1861 were published as illustrations by the Junior
Etching Club in <i>Passages from Modern English Poets</i>, and Whistler
proved the plates at the press of Day and Son, and met the lad he
called "the best professional printer in England," Frederick Goulding.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>Whistler told us that he worked about three weeks on each of the
Thames plates. He therefore must have spent on dated plates alone
thirty-six weeks in 1861, leaving but fourteen weeks for other work and
for play. Some of them are much less elaborate than the <i>Drouet</i>, which,
Drouet said, was done in five hours, so that it seems difficult to reconcile
the two statements. But it was about the <i>Black Lion Wharf</i>, one of
the fullest of detail, that we asked Whistler. We had many discussions
with him about them. Whistler maintained that they were youthful
performances, and J. as strongly maintained that that had nothing
to do with the matter; that he never surpassed the wonderful drawing
and composition and biting. He insisted that his later work in Venice
and in Holland was a great development, a great advance, and his final
answer was: "Well, you like them more than I do!" But there is
no doubt that the Thames plates, notably the <i>Black Lion Wharf</i>, have,
for artistic rendering of inartistic subjects and for perfect biting, never
been approached. Another thing that astonished J. was that he could
see such detail and put it on a copper-plate. "H'm," was Whistler's
comment, "that's what they all say."</p>

<p>Whistler got to know the Upper Thames when he stayed with Mr.
and Mrs. Edwin Edwards at Sunbury. Edwards figures in his dry-point
<i>Encamping</i> with M. W. Ridley, who was Whistler's first pupil,
and Traer, Haden's assistant, not "Freer," as he has long masqueraded
in Mr. Wedmore's catalogue. Ridley also is in <i>The Storm</i> and <i>The
Guitar-Player</i>. To these visits we owe an etching of <i>Whistler at
Moulsey</i>, by Edwards. Whistler introduced Fantin, who, in a note for
1861, refers to the "<i>jolies journées chez Edwards à Sunbury</i>." Mrs.
Edwards wrote us shortly before her death:</p>

<p>"Whistler often came to see me, turning up always when least
expected, perhaps driving down in a hansom cab from London. At
that time there was no railway at Sunbury; Hampton Court three
miles distant. He might send a line to be met by boat at Hampton
Court. He was always very eccentric."</p>

<p>Doubtless the driving down was an eccentricity. But Whistler
knew he might see some "foolish sunset," or a Nocturne, on the way.
"We had a large boat with waterproof cover," Mrs. Edwards added;
"my husband and friends several times went up the river and slept
in the boat. Whistler went once," when he did the plate <i>Encamping</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and possibly <i>Sketching</i> and <i>The Punt</i>, and in Mrs. Edwards' words,
"got rheumatism." It had been his trouble since St. Petersburg. He
could not risk exposure.</p>

<p>Whistler, though not settled in London, sent work regularly to
the Academy, where it was an unfailing shock to the critics. He showed
his <i>Mère Gérard</i> in 1861. The <i>Athenæum</i> described the picture as
"a fine, powerful-toned, and eminently characteristic study." The
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> thought it "far fitter hung over the stove in the
studio than exhibited at the Royal Academy, though it is replete with
evidence of genius and study. If Mr. Whistler would leave off using
mud and clay on his palette and paint cleanly, like a gentleman, we
should be happy to bestow any amount of praise on him, for he has
all the elements of a great artist in his composition. But we must
protest against his soiled and miry ways." It seemed a good, serious
study of an old woman and nothing more, when we saw it in the
London Memorial Exhibition, and the appallingly low level of the
Academy alone can explain the attention it attracted.</p>

<p>Whistler was in France in the summer of 1861, painting <i>The Coast of
Brittany</i>, or <i>Alone with the Tide</i>, which might have been signed by
Courbet&mdash;an arrangement in brown under a cloudy sky, a stretch of
sand at low tide in the foreground, water-washed rocks against which a
peasant girl sleeps, a deep blue sea beyond. It was "a beautiful thing,"
Whistler said years afterwards. At Perros Guirec he made his splendid
dry-point <i>The Forge</i>. Another print of this year is the rare dry-point
of Jo, who, for awhile, appeared in Whistler's work as often as Saskia
in Rembrandt's. She was Irish. Her father has been described to us
as a sort of Captain Costigan, and Jo&mdash;Joanna Heffernan, Mrs. Abbott&mdash;as
a woman of next to no education, but of keen intelligence, who,
before she had ceased to sit to Whistler, knew more about painting
than many painters, had become well read, and had great charm.
Her value to Whistler as a model was enormous, and she was an important
element in his life during the first London years. She was with
him in France in 1861-2, going to Paris in the winter to give him sittings
for the big <i>White Girl</i>, which he painted in a studio in the Boulevard
des Batignolles hung all in white. There Courbet met her, and,
looking at the copper-coloured hair, saw beauty in the beautiful.
He painted her, though perhaps not that winter, as <i>La Belle Irlandaise</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and as <i>Jo, femme d'Irlande</i>. Whistler's study of Jo, <i>Note Blanche</i>,
lent by Mrs. Sickert to the Paris Memorial Exhibition, was doubtless
done in 1861, for the technique is like Courbet's. Drouet remembered
breakfasts in the studio which Whistler cooked.</p>

<p>He fell ill before the end of the winter. Miss Chapman says he
was poisoned by the white lead used in the picture. Her brother, a
doctor, recommended a journey to the Pyrenees. At Guéthary
Whistler was nearly drowned when bathing. He wrote to Fantin:</p>

<p>"It was sunset, the sea was very rough, I was caught in the huge
waves, swallowing gallons of salt water. I swam and I swam, and the
more I swam the less near I came to the shore. Ah! my dear Fantin,
to feel my efforts useless and to know people were looking on saying,
'But the <i>Monsieur</i> amuses himself, he must be strong!' I cry, I scream
in despair&mdash;I disappear three, four times. At last they understand. A
brave railroad man rushes to me, and is rolled over twice on the sands.
My model hears the call, arrives at a gallop, jumps in the sea like a
Newfoundland, manages to catch me by the foot, and the two pull
me out."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>At Biarritz he painted <i>The Blue Wave</i>, a great sea rolling in and
breaking on the shore under a fine sky, but quite unlike the <i>Coast of
Brittany</i>. Whistler painted few pictures in which the composition,
the arrangement, is more obvious. It is an extraordinary piece of work.
It has lately been said that he painted this picture after he had seen
Courbet's <i>Vague</i>, now in the Louvre. But the <i>Vague</i> was not shown
until 1870. If there was any influence, it was all the other way.
At Fuenterrabia Whistler was in Spain, for the only time; "Spaniards
from the <i>Opéra-Comique</i> in the street, men in <i>bérets</i> and red blouses,
children like little Turks." He wanted to go farther, to Madrid,
and he urged Fantin to join him. Together they would look at <i>The
Lances</i> and <i>The Spinners</i> as together they had studied at the Louvre.
In another letter he promised to describe Velasquez to Fantin, to
bring back photographs. Such "glorious painting" should be copied.
"<i>Ah! mon cher, comme il a du travailler</i>," he winds up in his enthusiasm.
But the journey ended at Fuenterrabia. Fantin could not join him.
Madrid was put off for another spring, for ever, though the journey
was for ever being planned anew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> sent <i>The White Girl</i> to the Academy of 1862, with <i>The
Twenty-fifth of December, 1860, on the Thames</i>; <i>Alone with the Tide</i>;
and one etching, <i>Rotherithe</i>. <i>The White Girl</i> was rejected. The
two other pictures and the print were accepted, hung, and praised.
The <i>Athenæum</i> compared the <i>Rotherithe</i> to Rembrandt. Whistler
could scarcely be mentioned as an etcher without this comparison;
since Rembrandt his were "the most striking and original" etchings,
everyone then said, Mr. W. M. Rossetti being among the first in England
to say it boldly. <i>Alone with the Tide</i> was approved as "perfectly
expressed," and <i>The Twenty-fifth of December</i> as "broad and vigorous,
though perhaps vigour was pushed over the bounds of coarseness to
become mere dash." Other work he showed elsewhere was praised.
<i>The Punt</i> and <i>Sketching</i>, published in <i>Passages from Modern English
Poets</i>, were singled out for admiration. <i>Thames Warehouses</i> and <i>Black
Lion Wharf</i> won him recognition as "the most admirable etcher of
the present day," at South Kensington Museum, where in 1862 an
International Exhibition was held. Whistler had no pictures, but the
collection of modern continental art was one of the finest ever seen in
England.</p>

<p>In nothing had Whistler been so completely himself as in <i>The White
Girl</i>, and it failed to please. The artist is born to pick and choose,
and group with science, the elements in Nature that the result may be
beautiful, he wrote in <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, and <i>The White Girl</i> was his
first attempt to conform to a principle no one ever put so clearly into
words. It was an attempt, we know now, comparing the painting
to the symphonies and harmonies that came after. But at the time it
was disquieting in its defiance of modern conventions. It was without
subject according to Victorian standards, and the bold massing of
white upon white was more bewildering than the minute detail of the
Pre-Raphaelites. This summer (1862) the Berners Street Gallery was
opened, "with the avowed purpose of placing before the public the
works of young artists who may not have access to the ordinary
galleries." Maclise, Egg, Frith, Cooper, Poynter forced their way
in. But the Manager had the courage to exhibit <i>The White Girl</i>,
stating in the catalogue that the Royal Academy had refused it.
The <i>Athenæum</i> was independent enough to say that it was the most
prominent picture in the collection, though not the most perfect, for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"able as this bizarre production shows Mr. Whistler to be, we are
certain that in a very few years he will recognize the reasonableness of
its rejection. It is one of the most incomplete paintings we ever met
with. A woman in a quaint morning dress of white, with her hair about
her shoulders, stands alone in the background of nothing in particular.
But for the rich vigour of the textures, we might conceive this to be
some old portrait by Zucchero, or a pupil of his, practising in a provincial
town. The face is well done, but it is not that of Mr. Wilkie
Collins' <i>Woman in White</i>."</p>

<p>The criticism brought from Whistler his first letter to the press,
published in the <i>Athenæum</i>, July 5:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"62 Sloane Street. July 1, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p>"May I beg to correct an erroneous impression likely to be confirmed
in your last number? The Proprietors of the Berners Street
Gallery have, without my sanction, called my picture '<i>The Woman in
White</i>.' I had no intention whatever of illustrating Mr. Wilkie Collins'
novel; it so happens, indeed, that I have never read it. My painting
simply represents a girl dressed in white, standing in front of a white
curtain.&mdash;I am, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Whistler</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The critics were spared the sting of his wit, but they disapproved
strongly enough for him to tell his friends that <i>The White Girl</i> enjoyed
a <i>succès d'exécration</i>.</p>

<p>A different success awaited his Thames etchings in Paris, where they
were shown in a dealer's gallery. Baudelaire saw them and understood,
as he was the first to understand the work of Manet, Poe, Wagner,
and many others. He wrote:</p>

<p>"<i>Tout récemment, un jeune artiste américain, M. Whistler, exposait
à la galerie Martinet une série d'eaux fortes, subtiles, éveillées comme l'improvisation
et l'inspiration, représentant les bords de la Tamise; merveilleux
fouillis d'agrés, de vergues, de cordages; chaos de brumes, de fourneaux
et de fumées tire-bouchonnées; poésie profonde et compliquée d'une vaste
capitale.</i>"</p>

<p>According to Mr. W. M. Rossetti, Whistler soon moved to Queen's
Road, Chelsea: "I fancy that the houses in Queen's Road have been
much altered since Whistler was there in 1862-63. They were then low
(say two-storeyed), quite old-fashioned houses, of a cosy, homely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
character, with small forecourts. I have a kind of idea that Whistler's
house was No. 12, but this is quite uncertain to me.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> As my brother
and I were much in that neighbourhood, to and fro, prior to settling
down in No. 16 Cheyne Walk, we came into contact with Whistler, who
every now and then accompanied us on our jaunts. I forget how it was
exactly that we got introduced to him; possibly by Mr. Algernon
Swinburne, who was also to be an inmate of No. 16. Either (as I think)
before meeting Whistler or just about the time we met him, we had seen
one or two of his paintings. <i>At the Piano</i> must have been one, and we
most heartily admired him, and discerned unmistakably that he was
destined for renown."</p>

<p>The friendship may have led to Whistler's interest in black-and-white,
for in England it was Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood
who revolutionised illustration and proved it a dignified and
serious form of art. The more brilliant of the younger men were
working for the illustrated magazines, and Whistler found a place
among them. He made six drawings in 1862. Four appeared in
<i>Once a Week</i>: <i>The Morning before the Massacre of St. Bartholomew</i>,
<i>Count Burckhardt</i>, <i>The Major's Daughter</i>, <i>The Relief Fund in Lancashire</i>,
intended to be used as an illustration to the reprint of an address by
Tennyson on the subject of the famine in Lancashire, but never written
because of his illness. To this fund we believe Whistler contributed
a drawing. The two other illustrations, for <i>The First Sermon</i>, were
published in <i>Good Words</i>. They were drawn on wood in pencil, pen
and wash, are full of character, and, in the use of line, are like his
etchings. They were engraved by the Dalziel Brothers and Joseph
Swain, and from Mr. Strahan, the publisher of <i>Once a Week</i>, we have
these additional facts:</p>

<p>"They were arranged for by Edward Dalziel, and I cannot say
how he came to know the artist or his work, as Mr. Whistler was young
then, and, as far as I know, had not contributed to any magazine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>The average price we paid to artists was nine pounds, and we reckoned
that the same amount had to be paid for engravings. As a matter of
fact, the sum paid to Mr. Whistler was nine pounds for each drawing."</p>

<p>We showed Whistler once <i>The Morning before the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew</i>. "Well, now, not bad, you know&mdash;not bad even then!"
and he followed, with his expressive little finger, the flowing line,
pointing to the hand lost in the draperies. This and <i>The Major's
Daughter</i> were the two he preferred, and when J. was preparing <i>The
History of Modern Illustration</i> Whistler picked them out as "very pretty
ones" that should be reproduced, though, if but a single example
of his work could be used, he wished <i>The Morning before the Massacre</i>
to be selected, for it was "as delicate as an etching, and altogether
characteristic and personal." <i>Count Burckhardt</i> he did not care for,
insisting that he would rather not be represented if this were to be the
only example in the book. "It was never a favourite," he added.</p>

<p>The four drawings of <i>Once a Week</i> were reprinted in Thornbury's
<i>Legendary Ballads</i>, 1876. Thornbury implied that the drawings were
made for the book, and thought that "the startling drawings by
Mr. Whistler prove his singular power of hand, strong artistic feeling,
and daring manner."</p>

<p>Our copy belonged to George Augustus Sala. On the margin of
<i>The Morning before the Massacre</i> he wrote: "Jemmy Whistler.&mdash;Clever,
sketchy, and incomplete, like everything he has done. A loaf of
excellent, fine flour, but slack-baked." So Sala believed in 1883, and
it is typical of the time.</p>

<p>Another important work of 1862 was <i>The Last of Old Westminster</i>.
Mr. Arthur Severn knows more about it than anyone, as his account to
us explains: "On my return from Rome to join my brother in his rooms
in Manchester Buildings, on the Thames at Westminster Bridge (where
the New Scotland Yard now is), I found Whistler beginning his picture
of Westminster Bridge. My brother had given him permission to use
our sitting-room, with its bow-windows looking over the river and
towards the bridge. He was always courteous and pleasant in manner,
and it was interesting to see him at work. The bridge was in perspective,
still surrounded with piles, for it had only just been finished. It was
the piles with their rich colour and delightful confusion that took his
fancy, not the bridge, which hardly showed. He would look steadily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
at a pile for some time, then mix up the colour, then, holding his brush
quite at the end, with no mahlstick, make a downward stroke and the
pile was done. I remember his looking very carefully at a hansom
cab that had pulled up for some purpose on the bridge, and in a few
strokes he got the look of it perfectly. He was long over the picture,
sometimes coming only once a week, and we got rather tired of it.
One day some friends came to see it. He stood it against a table in
an upright position for them to see; it suddenly fell on its face, to my
brother's disgust, as he had just got a new carpet. Luckily Whistler's
sky was pretty dry, and I don't think the picture got any damage, and
the artist was most good-natured about my brother's anxiety lest the
carpet should have suffered."</p>

<p><i>The Last of Old Westminster</i> was ready for the Academy of 1863,
to which it was sent with six prints: <i>Weary</i>, <i>Old Westminster Bridge</i>,
<i>Hungerford Bridge</i>, <i>Monsieur Becquet</i>, <i>The Forge</i>, <i>The Pool</i>. The dignity
of composition in the picture and the vigour of handling impressed
all who saw it in the London Memorial Exhibition, though they had
to regret its shocking condition, cracked from end to end. It failed to
impress Academicians in 1863, and was badly hung, as were the prints,
reproductive work being then, as now, preferred to original etching.</p>

<p><i>The White Girl</i>, after its Berners Street success, was sent by Whistler
to the <i>Salon</i>. He took it to Paris, to Fantin's studio, there having it
unrolled and framed. It is hard to say why the strongest work of the
strongest young men was rejected from the <i>Salon</i> of 1863. Fantin,
Legros, Manet, Bracquemond, Jongkind, Harpignies, Cazin, Jean-Paul
Laurens, Vollon, Whistler were refused. It was a scandal; 1859 was
nothing to it. The town was in an uproar that reached the ears of
the Emperor. Martinet, the dealer, offered to show the rejected
pictures in his gallery. But before this was arranged, Napoleon III
ordered that a <i>Salon des Refusés</i> should be held in the same building
as the official <i>Salon</i>, the <i>Palais de l'Industrie</i>. The decree was published
in the <i>Moniteur</i> for April 24, 1863. The notice was issued by the
<i>Directeur-Général</i> of the Imperial Museums, and the exhibition opened
on May 15. The success was as great as the scandal. The exhibition
was the talk of the town, it was caricatured as the <i>Exposition des
Comiques</i>, and parodied as the <i>Club des Refusés</i> at the <i>Variétés</i>; everyone
rushed to the galleries. The rooms were crowded by artists, because,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in the midst of much no doubt weak and foolish, the best work of
the day was shown; by the public, because of the stir the affair made.
The public laughed with the idea that it was a duty to laugh, and
because the critics said that never was <i>succès pour rire</i> better deserved.
Zola described in <i>L'&OElig;uvre</i> the gaiety and cruelty of the crowd, convulsed
and hysterical in front of <i>La Dame en Blanc</i>. Hamerton wrote
in the <i>Fine Arts Quarterly</i>:</p>

<p>"The hangers must have thought her particularly ugly, for they
have given her a sort of place of honour, before an opening through
which all pass, so that nobody misses her. I watched several parties,
to see the impression <i>The Woman in White</i> made on them. They all
stopped instantly, struck with amazement. This for two or three
seconds, then they always looked at each other and laughed. Here,
for once, I have the happiness to be quite of the popular way of thinking."</p>

<p>On the other hand, Fernand Desnoyers, who wrote a pamphlet on
the <i>Salon des Refusés</i>, thought that Whistler was "<i>le plus spirite des
peintres</i>," and the painting the most original that had passed before
the jury of the <i>Salon</i>, altogether remarkable, at once simple and fantastic,
the portrait of a spirit, a medium, though of a beauty so peculiar
that the public did not know whether to think it beautiful or ugly. Paul
Mantz considered it the most important picture in the exhibition, full
of knowledge and strange charm, and his article in the <i>Gazette des
Beaux-Arts</i> is the more interesting because he described the picture as
a <i>Symphonie du Blanc</i> some years before Whistler called it so, and
pointed out that it carried on French tradition, for, a hundred years
earlier, painters had shown in the <i>Salon</i> studies of white upon white.</p>

<p>The picture hardly explained the sensation of its first appearance
when we saw it with <i>Miss Alexander</i>, the <i>Mother</i>, <i>Carlyle</i>, <i>The Fur
Jacket</i>, and <i>Irving</i> in the London Memorial Exhibition. But it seemed
revolutionary enough in the sixties, to become the <i>clou</i> of the <i>Salon des
Refusés</i>, though nothing was further from Whistler's intention. It
eclipsed Manet's <i>Déjeuner sur l'herbe</i>, then called <i>Le Bain</i>.</p>

<p>Whistler was in Amsterdam with Legros, looking at Rembrandt
with delight, at Van der Helst with disappointment, etching <i>Amsterdam
from the Tolhuis</i>, no doubt hunting for old paper and adding to his
collection of blue and white, when the news came of the reception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
his picture in Paris, and he wrote to Fantin that he longed to be there
and in the movement. It was a satisfaction that the picture, slighted in
London, should be honoured in Paris. He was all impatience to know
what was said in the <i>Café de Bade</i>, the <i>café</i> of Manet, and by the critics.</p>

<p>To add to his triumph in Paris, official honours were coming to
him in Holland and England. Some of his etchings were in an exhibition
at The Hague, though he said he did not know how they got there,
and he was given one of three gold medals awarded to foreigners&mdash;his
first medal. Though atrociously hung at the Academy, his prints
were honoured at the British Museum, where twelve were bought for
the Print Room this year.</p>

<p>The excitement did not keep him from work, to which, as he wrote
to Fantin, wandering was a drawback. He felt the need of his studio,
of "the familiar all about him." The "familiar" he loved best was
in London, and when he returned he began to look for a house of his
own. It was fortunate for him that his mother was in England. At
the beginning of the Civil War, in which Whistler took the keenest
interest as a patriot and a "West Point man," she had been in Richmond
with her son William, serving as surgeon in the Confederate Army,
had run the blockade, and come to join her other children in London.</p>

<p>Whistler no longer made the Hadens' house his home. The relations
of the brothers-in-law had become strained, both being of strong
character. Haden had had much to put up with, while Whistler, the
artist, resented the criticism of Haden, the surgeon. One story we
have from Whistler explains the situation, and though he never gave a
date, it can be told here. Haden was the schoolmaster Whistler found
him when they first met; one's older relatives have a way of forgetting
one can grow up. Once, when Whistler had done something more
enormous than ever in Haden's eyes, he was summoned to the workroom
upstairs, and lectured until he refused to listen to another word.
He started down the four flights of stairs, with Haden close behind
still lecturing. At last the front door was reached. And then:
"Oh, dear," said Whistler, "I've left my hat upstairs, and now we
have got to go all through this again!" As there was no further
question of Whistler living with the Hadens, it was decided that he
and his mother should live together, and some of his most delightful
years were those that followed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X: CHELSEA DAYS.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
SIXTY-THREE TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY-SIX.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p>Whistler's first house in London was No. 7 Lindsey Row, Chelsea,
now 101 Cheyne Walk. It adjoins the old palace of Lord Lindsey,
which still stands, the original building divided into several houses,
stuccoed and modernised, much of its stateliness gone, though the
spacious stairway and part of the panelling have been preserved.
Whistler's was a three-storey house, with a garden in front, humble
compared with the palaces Academicians were building. "All these
artists complain of nothing but the too great prosperity of the profession
in these days," Hamerton wrote to his wife; "they tell me an artist's
life is a princely one now." But Whistler lived his own life, and from
his windows he could paint what he wanted. Only the road separated
the house from the river; opposite was Battersea Church and a group
of factory chimneys; old Battersea Bridge stretched across, and at
night he could see the lights of Cremorne.</p>

<p>At the end of the Row the boat-builder Greaves lived. He had
worked in Chelsea for years. He had rowed Turner about on the river,
and his two sons were to row Whistler. One of the sons, Mr. Walter
Greaves, has told us that Mrs. Booth, a big, hard, coarse Scotchwoman,
was always with Turner when he came for a boat. Turner would
ask Greaves what kind of a day it was going to be, and if Greaves
answered "Fine," he would get Greaves to row them across to Battersea
Church, or to the fields, now Battersea Park. If Greaves was doubtful
Turner would say: "Well, Mrs. Booth, we won't go far," and afterwards
for the sons&mdash;boys at the time&mdash;Turner in their memory was
overshadowed by her. They had also known Martin, the painter of big
Scriptural <i>machines</i>, whose house was in the middle of the Row. It
had a balcony, and on fine moonlight nights, or nights of dramatic
skies, Greaves or one of the sons would knock him up, and keep on
knocking until they saw the old man in his nightcap on the balcony,
where he would get to work and sketch the sky until daylight. Greaves
remembered, too, Brunel, who built the <i>Great Eastern</i>, living at the
end of the Row. Of other associations, dating a couple of centuries
before, the little Moravian graveyard at the back was a reminder,
for Lindsey Palace was one of the first refuges of Zinzendorf and the
Brotherhood. A hundred years or so later Mrs. Gaskell was born there.
The Row, indeed, was a place of history. But Whistler was to make it
more famous.</p>

<p>The two Greaves, Walter and Harry, painted, and Whistler let
them work with and for him. We have often heard him speak of them
as his pupils. From them he learned to row. "He taught us to
paint, and we taught him the waterman's jerk," Mr. Walter Greaves
says. Whistler would start with them in the twilight, Albert Moore
sometimes his companion, and they would stay on the river for hours,
often all night, lingering in the lights of Cremorne, drifting into the
shadows of the bridge. Or else he was up with the dawn, throwing
pebbles at their windows to wake them and make them come and pull
him up or down stream. At night, on the river and at Cremorne, he
was never without brown paper and black and white chalk, with which
he made his notes for the Nocturnes and the seemingly simple, but really
complicated, firework pictures. In the Gardens it was easy to put
down what he wanted under the lamps. On the river he had to trust to
his memory, only noting the reflections in white chalk.</p>

<p>Walter Greaves, in his exhibition of 1911, made the statement, or
allowed it to be made, that before he and his brother knew Whistler, they
were "painting pictures of the Thames and Cremorne Gardens, both day
and night effects." This statement Mr. Greaves was unable to substantiate
by dates and facts, and as other dates and facts given in his
catalogue were wrong, little reliance can be placed upon it. He and his
brother were Whistler's pupils, and they worked for Whistler for many
years, helping him, at any rate until after The Peacock Room. Whistler
naturally wished to control his pupils in their work as any other master
would, as he controlled and directed the work of Mr. and Mrs. Clifford
Addams, his last pupils. He also did his best to prevent Mr. Walter
Greaves and his brother from appropriating his subjects, which letters
from Whistler to Greaves prove was exactly what they were doing.
They were to carry on his tradition, and this included his methods
and even at times his colours which they used, while Whistler as
undoubtedly worked on their canvases and plates as he worked on
those of other pupils at later dates. But the statement that he refused
to allow them to exhibit is untrue, for on the few occasions when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
are able to find that Greaves did exhibit, it was because Whistler, in
his generosity, got the pictures hung. In his recent exhibition Greaves
showed a painting called <i>Passing under Old Battersea Bridge</i>, signed
and dated 1862, and he stated that he had exhibited it in the International
Exhibition at South Kensington of that year. No other
picture we have seen by him has any such date or signature on it, and
his statement that it was in the International Exhibition of 1862
has been proved false. It is now admitted that he did not show until
1873. There are two distinct qualities of work in the picture which
must be the work either of two people or of two periods. The piers
of the bridge are hard and tight, the background resembles Whistler's
work of years later, for neither Whistler nor Greaves had painted a
Nocturne in that manner at the time. Nevertheless, these misstatements
of Greaves were used by critics all over the world to belittle
Whistler.</p>

<p>At one time, master and pupils attended a life class held in the evening
by M. Barthe, a Frenchman, in Limerston Street, not far from the
Row. Mr. J. E. Christie was another student, and from him we have
the following account:</p>

<p>"Whistler was not a regular attender, but came occasionally, and
always accompanied by two young men&mdash;brothers&mdash;Greaves by name.
They simply adored Whistler, and were not unlike him in appearance,
owing to an unconscious imitation of his dress and manner. It was
amusing to watch the movements of the trio when they came into the
studio (always late). The curtain that hung in front of the door would
suddenly be pulled back by one of the Greaves, and a trim, prim little
man, with a bright, merry eye, would step in with 'Good evening,'
cheerfully said to the whole studio. After a second's survey, while
taking off his gloves, he would hand his hat to the other brother, who
hung it up carefully as if it were a sacred thing, then he would wipe
his brow and moustache with a spotless handkerchief, then in the most
careful way he arranged his materials, and sat down. Then, having
imitated in a general way the preliminaries, the two Greaves sat down on
either side of him. There was a sort of tacit understanding that his
and their studies should not be subjected to our rude gaze. I, however,
saw, with the tail of my eye, as it were, that Whistler made small drawings
on brown paper with coloured chalks, that the figure (always a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
female figure) would be about four inches long, that the drawing was
bold and fine, and not slavishly like the model. The comical part was
that his satellites didn't draw from the model at all, that I saw, but sat
looking at Whistler's drawing and copying that as far as they could.
He never entered into the conversation, which was unceasing, but
occasionally rolled a cigarette and had a few whiffs, the Greaves
brothers always requiring their whiffs at the same time. The trio
packed up, and left before the others always."</p>

<p>Sometimes in the evening Whistler, with his mother, would go to
the Greaves' house after dinner, and work there. Often he sent in
dessert, that they might enjoy and talk over it together. Then he
would bring out his brown paper and chalks and make studies of the
family and of himself, or sketches of pictures he had seen, working
until midnight and after. In those days he never went to bed until
he had drawn a portrait of himself, he told us. Many of the portraits
are in existence. The sister was an accomplished musician, and
Whistler delighted in music, though he was not critical, for he was
known to call the passing hurdy-gurdy into his front garden, and have
it ground under his windows. Occasionally the brothers played so that
Whistler might dance. He was always full of drolleries and fun. He
would imitate a man sawing, or two men fighting at the door so cleverly
that Mrs. Greaves never ceased to be astonished when he walked into the
room alone and unhur. He delighted in American mechanical toys,
and his house was full of Japanese dolls. One great doll, dressed like a
man, he would take with him not only to the Greaves', but to dinners
at Little Holland House, where the Prinseps then lived, and to other
houses, where he put it through amazing performances.</p>

<p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti was, by this time, settled in Tudor House
(now Queen's House), not far from Lindsey Row, and Swinburne and
George Meredith were living with him. Mr. W. M. Rossetti came
for two or three nights every week, and Frederick Sandys, Charles
Augustus Howell, William Bell Scott, and, several years later, Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton were constant visitors.</p>

<p>For Rossetti Whistler had a genuine affection, and, in his early
enthusiasm, wrote of him as "<i>une grand artiste</i>" to Fantin. But
later his enthusiasm did not blind him. "A charming fellow, the only
white man in all that crowd of painters," he assured us; "not an artist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
you know, but charming and a gentleman." Mr. Watts-Dunton says
that Rossetti got tired of Whistler after awhile, and considered him
a brainless fellow, who had no more than a malicious quick wit at the
expense of others, and no genuine philosophy or humour. But Whistler
never realised any change in Rossetti's feelings towards him.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that Whistler and Rossetti should disagree in
matters of art. Whistler asked Rossetti why he did not frame his
sonnets. Rossetti thought that the "new French School," in which
Whistler had been trained, was "simply putrescence and decomposition."
It is said that Rossetti influenced Whistler. Whistler influenced
him as much. They influenced each other in the choice of
models, in a certain luxuriance of type and the manner of presenting
it, an influence which was superficial and transitory.</p>

<p>Upon many other subjects they agreed. Rossetti shared Whistler's
delight in drollery and his love of the fantastic. No one understood
better than Whistler why Rossetti filled his house and garden with
strange beasts. It was from Whistler we heard of the peacock and
the gazelle, who fought until the peacock was left standing desolate,
with his tail strewed upon the ground. From Whistler, too, we had
the story of the bull of Bashan, bought at Cremorne, and tied to a
stake in the garden, and Rossetti would come every day and talk to him,
until once the bull got so excited that he pulled up the stake and made
for Rossetti, who went tearing round and round a tree, a little fat
person with coat-tails flying, finally, by a supreme effort, rushing up
the garden steps just in time to slam the door in the bull's face. Rossetti
called his man and ordered him to tie up the bull, but the man, who had
looked out for the menagerie, who had gone about the house with peacocks
and other creatures under his arms, who had rescued armadilloes
from irate neighbours, who had captured monkeys from the tops of
chimneys, struck when it came to tying up a bull of Bashan on the
rampage, and gave a month's warning. From Whistler also we first
had the story of the wombat, bought at Jamrach's by Rossetti for its
name. Whistler was dining at Tudor House, and the wombat was
brought on the table with coffee and cigars, while Meredith talked
brilliantly, and Swinburne read aloud passages from the <i>Leaves of Grass</i>.
But Meredith was witty as well as brilliant, and the special target of his
wit was Rossetti, who, as he had invited two or three of his patrons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
did not appreciate the jest. The evening ended less amiably than it
began, and no one thought of the wombat until late, and then it
had disappeared. It was searched for high and low. Days passed,
weeks passed, months passed, and there was no wombat. It was regretted,
forgotten. Long afterwards Rossetti, who was not much of a
smoker, got out the box of cigars he had not touched since that dinner.
He opened it. Not a cigar was left, but there was the skeleton of the
wombat.</p>

<p>Whistler and Rossetti also agreed about many of the group who
met at Tudor House, though eventually Whistler felt what appeared to
him the disloyalty of Swinburne and Burne-Jones. He was never, at
any time, so intimate with Burne-Jones as with Swinburne, who often
came to the house in Lindsey Row, not only for Whistler's sake, but out
of affection for Whistler's mother. Miss Chapman tells us that Swinburne
was once taken ill there suddenly, and Mrs. Whistler nursed him
till he was well. Miss Chapman also remembers Swinburne sitting
at Mrs. Whistler's feet, and saying to her: "Mrs. Whistler, what has
happened? It used to be Algernon!" Mrs. Whistler, who had
accepted Whistler's friends and their ways, said quietly, "You have not
been to see us for a long while, you know. If you come as you did,
it will be Algernon again." And he came, and the friendship lasted
until the eighties, when he published the article in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> which Whistler could not forgive.</p>

<p>Meredith wrote us of these Chelsea days: "I knew Whistler and
never had a dissension with him, though merry bouts between us
were frequent. When I went to live in the country, we rarely met.
He came down to stay with me once. He was a lively companion,
never going out of his way to take offence, but with the springs in him
prompt for the challenge. His tales of his student life in Paris, and
of one Ernest, with whom he set forth on a holiday journey with next
to nothing in his purse, were <i>impayable</i>."</p>

<p>Quarrels and distrust never made Whistler deny the charm of
Charles Augustus Howell, remembered for the part he played in the
lives of some of the most distinguished people of his generation.
Who he was, where he came from, nobody knew. He was supposed
to be associated with high, but nameless, personages in Portugal,
and sent by them on a secret mission to England: he was said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
have been involved in the Orsini conspiracy, and obliged to fly for
his life across the Channel. According to Mr. E. T. Cook, he was
descended from Boabdil il Chico, though Rossetti called him "the
cheeky." Mr. Cook says that in his youth, as he used to tell, he
had supported his family by diving for treasure, and had lived in
Morocco as the Sheik of a Tribe. But Ford Madox Brown described
him as the Münchausen of the Pre-Raphaelite circle. The unquestionable
fact is that he was a man of great personal charm and unusual
business capacity. Mr. W. M. Rossetti has written of him: "As a
salesman&mdash;with his open manner, winning address, and his exhaustless
gift of amusing talk, not innocent of high colouring and of actual
<i>blague</i>&mdash;Howell was unsurpassable."</p>

<p>He was secretary to Ruskin; he was Rossetti's man of affairs;
he became Whistler's, though on a less definite basis. He appears in
published reminiscences as the magnificent prototype of the author's
agent. His talk was one of his recommendations to both Rossetti
and Whistler. Rossetti rejoiced in Howell's "Niagara of lies," and
immortalised them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i1"><i>"There's a Portuguese person called Howell,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Who lays on his lies with a trowel;</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>When I goggle my eyes,</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>And start with surprise,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>'Tis at the monstrous big lies told by Howell."</i></div>
<br /></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whistler described him as "the wonderful man, the genius, the
Gil Blas-Robinson Crusoe hero out of his proper time, the creature
of top-boots and plumes, splendidly flamboyant, the real hero of the
Picaresque novel, forced by modern conditions into other adventures,
and along other roads."</p>

<p>Whistler gave Howell credit for more than picturesqueness. He
had the instinct for beautiful things, Whistler said: "He knew them
and made himself indispensable by knowing them. He was of the
greatest service to Rossetti; he helped Watts to sell his pictures
and raise his prices; he acted as artistic adviser to Mr. Howard,
Lord Carlisle. He had the gift of intimacy; he was at once a friend,
on closest terms of confidence. He introduced everybody to everybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
else, he entangled everybody with everybody else, and it was easier
to get involved with Howell than to get rid of him."</p>

<p>Many years passed before there was any wish on Whistler's part to
get rid of him. He was soon as frequent a visitor at Lindsey Row
as at Tudor House. For a time he lived at Putney, and Whistler
used to take his morning pull up the river to breakfast with him. Of
none of the Rossetti group did Whistler so often talk to us as of Howell,
telling us his adventures&mdash;adventures in pursuit of old furniture and
china until he was known to, and loved and hated by, every pawnbroker
in London, and seemed to spend all his time with rare and beautiful
things; adventures with creditors and bailiffs: once his collection of
blue pots saved by a device only Howell could have invented, forty
blue pots carried off in forty four-wheelers to the law-courts, where
he was complimented by the judge and awarded heavy damages by
the jury; adventures as vestryman, giving teas to hundreds of schoolchildren;
adventures at Selsea Bill, where three cottages were turned
into a house for himself and he swaggered in the village as a great
personage, finding an occupation in stripping the copper from an old
wreck that had been there for years and possibly selling it to etchers;
adventures ending eventually in <i>The Paddon Papers</i>, of which there will
be something to say when the date of their publication is reached.</p>

<p>Frederick Sandys' work never interested Whistler, but Sandys
the man was a delight to him, though the two lost sight of each other
for many years. Sandys was usually without a penny in his pocket,
but he faced the situation with calm and swagger. Accidents never
separated him from his white waistcoat, though he might have to carry
it himself to the laundry, or get his model, "the little girl" he called
her, to carry it for him. You were always meeting them with the
brown-paper parcel, Whistler said, and at the nearest friend's house
he would stop for five minutes and emerge from it splendid in a clean
waistcoat. In money matters he reckoned like a Rothschild. It was
always, "Huh! five hundred," that he wanted. Late one afternoon,
as Whistler was going into Rossetti's, he met Sandys coming out
unusually depressed. He stopped Whistler:</p>

<p>"Do, do try and reason with Gabriel, huh! He is most thoughtless.
He says I must go to America, and I must have five hundred, huh,
and go! But, if I could go, huh, I could stay!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Once Whistler, Sandys, and Rossetti are said to have gone to Winchelsea
with W. G. Wills, Irving, and Alfred Calmour, from whom the
story comes. Whistler and Rossetti wanted to see a beautiful old
house. A grumpy old man lived in it, but Irving warned them that
he would probably ask them all to dinner. Rossetti said they must
refuse, he hated dining with strangers; Whistler was sure the wine
would be bad, Sandys as certain they would be bored by infernal chatter.
But they went to the house. Whistler knocked. The servant opened.
Whistler asked him to tell his master that "Mr. Whistler and Mr. Rossetti
and Mr. Irving wish to see the place." A rough voice was heard:
"Shut the door, Roger, I don't want these damned show people
stealing my silver." Whistler and Rossetti were furious, and thought
they should demand an apology. "He thinks we are confounded
actors," Whistler said. "My dear James, he's never heard of <i>you</i>!"
was Irving's comment. The only drawback to the story is that we
doubt if Whistler knew Irving until after he had ceased to see anything
of Rossetti and Sandys.</p>

<p>Whistler got to know other friends of Rossetti's, and he drifted to
Ford Madox Brown's, in Fitzroy Square: "Once in a long while I would
take my gaiety, my sunniness, to Madox Brown's receptions. And
there were always the most wonderful people&mdash;the Blinds, Swinburne,
anarchists, poets and musicians, all kinds and sorts, and, in an inner
room, Rossetti and Mrs. Morris sitting side by side in state, being
worshipped, and, fluttering round them, Howell with a broad red
ribbon across his shirt-front, a Portuguese decoration hereditary in
the family."</p>

<p>According to his grandson, Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer, Ford Madox
Brown thought so much of Whistler's work that once, knowing Whistler
wanted money, he sent round among his friends a circular praising
Whistler's etchings and urging their purchase.</p>

<p>Whistler shared Rossetti's interest in the spiritual manifestations
that, for several years, agitated the circle at Tudor House. He told
us once of the strange things that happened when he went to <i>séances</i>
at Rossetti's with Jo, and also when he and Jo tried the same things in
his studio, and a cousin from the South, long dead, talked to him and
told him much that no one else could have known. He believed, but
he gave up the <i>séances</i> when they threatened to become engrossing,
for he felt that he would be obliged to sacrifice to them the work he
had to do in the world.</p>

<p>The chief bond between Whistler and Rossetti was their love for
blue and white and Japanese prints. Whistler was in Paris in 1856,
when Bracquemond "discovered" Japan in a little volume of Hokusai
used for packing china, and rescued by Delâtre, the printer. It
passed into the hands of Laveille, the engraver, and from him
Bracquemond obtained it. After that, Bracquemond had the book
always by him; and when in 1862 Madame Desoye, who, with her
husband, had lived in Japan, opened a shop under the arcades of the
Rue de Rivoli, the enthusiasm spread to Manet, Fantin, Tissot, Jacquemart
and Solon, Baudelaire and the De Goncourts. Rossetti was
supposed to have made it the fashion. But the fashion in Paris began
before Rossetti owned his first blue pot or his first colour-print.
Whistler brought the knowledge and the love of the art to London.
"It was he who invented blue and white in London," Mr. Murray
Marks assured us, and Mr. W. M. Rossetti was as certain that his brother
was inspired by Whistler, who bought not only blue and white, but
sketch-books, colour-prints, lacquers, kakemonos, embroideries, screens.
"In his house in Chelsea, facing Battersea Bridge," Mr. Severn writes,
"he had lovely blue and white, Chinese and Japanese." The only
decorations, except the harmony of colour, were the prints on the walls,
a flight of Japanese fans in one place, in another shelves of blue and
white. People, copying him, stuck up fans anywhere, and hung plates
from wires. Whistler's fans were arranged for colour and line. His
decorations bewildered people even more than the work of the new
firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. The Victorian artist
covered his walls with tapestry, filled his studio with costly things,
and made the public measure beauty by price, a fact overlooked by
Whistler, but never by Morris.</p>

<p>Rossetti joined in the hunt for blue and white. Henry Treffy Dunn,
in his <i>Recollections of Rossetti</i>, whose assistant he was, writes that Rossetti
and Whistler "each tried to outwit the other in picking up the
choicest pieces of blue to be met with"; that both were for ever hunting
for "Long Elizas," a name in which Mr. W. M. Rossetti thought
"possibly a witticism of Whistler's may be detected." Howell rushed
in and met with the most astounding experiences and adventures. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
little shop in the Strand was one of their favourite haunts, another was
near London Bridge where a Japanese print was given away with a
pound of tea. Farmer and Rogers had an Oriental warehouse in Regent
Street. The manager, Mr. Lazenby Liberty, afterwards opened one on
the other side of the street, and here, too, Whistler went, introduced to
Mr. Liberty by Rossetti. Mr. Liberty rendered him many a service,
and visited him to the last. Mr. Murray Marks imported blue and white,
and he has told us how the fever spread from Whistler and Rossetti
to the ever-anxious collector. Rossetti asked Mr. Marks if he knew
anything about blue and white. Mr. Marks said yes; he could get
Rossetti a shipload if he chose. Mr. Marks often ran over to Holland,
where blue and white was common and cheap, and he picked up a lot,
offering it to Rossetti for fifty pounds. Rossetti happened to be hard up
and could not afford it. But he came with Mr. Huth, who bought as
much as Rossetti could not take, and the rage for it began in England,
Sir Henry Thompson, among others, commencing to collect. The rivalry
between Whistler and Rossetti lasted for several years, until Rossetti,
ill and broken, hardly saw his friends, and until Mr. Marks, in the early
seventies, bought back from Whistler and Rossetti all he had sold them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI: CHELSEA DAYS.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
SIXTY-THREE TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY-SIX CONTINUED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Whistler's correspondence with Fantin between 1860 and 1865,
published in part by M. Bénédite in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> (1905),
it can be seen that he was outgrowing the influence of Courbet, and
that his reaction against realism was bitter. In his revolt he deliberately
built up subjects that had nothing to do with life as he knew it,
and he borrowed the motives from Japan.</p>

<p>It was in the studio at No. 7 Lindsey Row&mdash;no huge, gorgeous,
tapestry-hung, <i>bric-à-brac</i> crowded hall, but a little second storey,
or English first floor, back room&mdash;that the Japanese pictures were
painted. The method was a development of his earlier work. The
difference was in the subjects. He did not conceal his "machinery."
<i>The Lange Leizen</i>, <i>The Gold Screen</i>, <i>The Balcony</i>, the <i>Princesse du Pays
de la Porcelaine</i> were endeavours to render a beauty he had discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which was unknown in Western life. There was no attempt at the
"learning" of Tadema or the "morality" of Holman Hunt. Whistler's
models were not Japanese. The lady of <i>The Lange Leizen</i> sits on a
chair as she never would have sat in the land from which her costume
came, and the pots and trays and flowers around her are in a profusion
never seen in the houses of Tokio or Canton. In <i>The Gold Screen</i> pose
and arrangement are equally inappropriate. The <i>Princesse</i>, in her
trailing robes, is as little Japanese. When he left the studio and took
his canvas to the front of the house and painted <i>The Balcony</i>, though
he clothed the English models in Eastern dress and gave them Eastern
instruments to play upon, and placed them before Japanese screens
and Anglo-Japanese railings, their background was the Thames with
the chimneys of Battersea. We have heard of a Chinese bamboo
rack he used for these railings, though some remember it as a studio
property made from his design. Nothing save the beauty of the
detail mattered to Whistler. It was not the real Japan he wanted
to paint, but his idea of it, just as Rembrandt painted his idea of the
Holy Land.</p>

<p>The titles he afterwards found for these pictures are <i>Purple and
Rose</i>, <i>Caprice in Purple and Gold</i>, <i>Harmony in Flesh Colour and Green</i>,
<i>Rose and Silver</i>. Harmony was what he sought, though no Dutchman
surpassed their delicacy of detail, truth of texture, intricacy of pattern.
And yet we are conscious in them of artificial structure as in none of
his other work; the models do not live in their Japanese draperies;
Eastern detail is out of place on the banks of the Thames; the device
is too obvious.</p>

<p>The <i>Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine</i> is the portrait of Miss
Christine Spartali, daughter of the Greek Consul-General in London,
whom Whistler met at Ionides', and to whose dinners and parties
he often went. There were two daughters, Christine (Countess Edmond
de Cahen) and Marie (Mrs. W. J. Stillman), both beautiful.
Whistler and Rossetti were struck by their beauty, and Whistler
asked the younger sister, Christine, to sit to him. Mrs. Stillman,
who always accompanied her, has told us the story of the picture.
Before they came to the studio Whistler had his scheme prepared.
The Japanese robe was ready, the rug and screen were in place, and
he posed her at once. There are a number of small studies and sketches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in oil and pastel that show he knew what he wanted. She sat twice
a week during the winter of 1863-64. At first the work went quickly,
then it began to drag. Whistler often rubbed it out just as she thought
it finished, and day after day she returned to find that everything
was to be done over again. The parents got tired, but not the two
girls. Mrs. Stillman remembers that Whistler partly closed the shutters
so as to shut out the direct light; that her sister stood at one end
of the room, the canvas beside her; that Whistler would look at the
picture from a distance, then dash at it, give one stroke, then dash
away again. As a rule, they arrived about half-past ten or a quarter
to eleven; he painted steadily, forgetting everything else, and it was
often long after two before they lunched. When lunch was served,
it was brought into the studio, placed on a low table, and they sat
on stools. There were no such lunches anywhere. Mrs. Whistler
provided American dishes, strange in London; among other things,
raw tomatoes, a surprise to the Greek girls, who had never eaten
tomatoes except over-cooked as the Greeks liked them, and canned
apricots and cream, which they had never eaten at all. One <i>menu</i>
was roast pheasants, followed by tomato salad, and the apricots and
cream, usually with champagne. One cannot wonder that there were
occasional deficits in the bank account at Lindsey Row. But it was
not only the things to eat and drink that made the hour a delight.
Whistler, silent when he worked, was gay at lunch. Perhaps better
than his charm, Mrs. Stillman remembers his devotion to his mother,
who was calm and dignified, with something of the sweet peacefulness
of the Friends. After lunch work was renewed, and it was four and
later before they were released.</p>

<p>The sittings went on until the sitter fell ill. Whistler was pitiless
with his models. The head in the <i>Princesse</i> gave him most trouble.
He kept Miss Spartali standing while he worked at it, never letting her
rest; she must keep the entire pose, and she would not admit her
fatigue as long as she could help it. During her illness a model stood
for the gown, and when she was getting better he came one day and
made a pencil drawing of her head, though what became of it Mrs.
Stillman never knew. There were a few sittings after this, and at
last the picture was finished. The two girls wanted their father to
buy it, but Mr. Spartali did not like it. He objected to it as a portrait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of his daughter. Appreciation of art was not among the virtues of
the London Greeks. Alexander Ionides and his sons were almost
alone in preferring a good thing.</p>

<p>Rossetti, glad to be of service, tried to sell the picture. Whistler
agreed to take a hundred pounds, and Rossetti placed the canvas in his
studio, where it would be seen by a collector who was coming to look
at his work. The collector came, saw the <i>Princesse</i>, liked it, wanted
it. There was one objection: Whistler's signature in big letters
across the canvas. If Whistler would change the signature he would
take the picture. Rossetti, enchanted, hurried to tell Whistler.
Whistler was indignant. The request showed what manner of man
the patron was, one in whose possession he did not care to have any
work of his. However, Rossetti sold the <i>Princesse</i> to another collector,
who died shortly afterwards, and then it was bought by Frederick
Leyland, and so led to the decoration of The Peacock Room.</p>

<p>It is possible that this objection helped Whistler to realise the
inharmonious effect of a large signature on a picture. It is sure that,
about this time, he began to arrange his initials somewhat after the
Japanese fashion. They were first interlaced in an oblong or circular
frame like the signatures of Japanese artists. He signed his name
to the earliest pictures, even to some of the Japanese. But with the
Nocturnes and the large portraits the Butterfly appeared, made from
working the letters J. M. W. into a design, which became more fantastic
until it evolved into the Butterfly in silhouette, and continued in various
forms. In the <i>Carlyle</i> the Butterfly is enclosed in a round frame,
like a cut-out silhouette, behind the figure, and repeats the prints on
the wall. In the <i>Miss Alexander</i> it is in a large semicircle and is far
more distinctly a butterfly. Then it grew like a stencil, though in
no sense was it one, as may be seen in M. Duret's portrait, where the
Butterfly is made simply in silhouette, on the background, by a few
touches of the rose of the opera cloak and the fan. It was introduced
as a note of colour, as important in the picture as any other detail,
and at times it was put in almost at the first painting to judge the
effect, scraped out with the whole thing, put in again somewhere else,
this repeated until he got it right. We have seen many an unfinished
picture with a wonderfully finished Butterfly, because it was just where
Whistler wanted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The same development can be traced in his etchings, in which
it began to appear as a bit of decoration. He originally signed the
prints, and signed the plates with his name and date bitten in. But
later the prints were signed with the Butterfly, followed by "<i>imp</i>,"
while the Butterfly alone was etched on the copper or drawn on the
stone. Then he added the Butterfly to his signature to letters and
his dedication on prints. And the Butterfly found its way to his invitation
cards, and at last his correspondence, public and private, was
usually signed with the Butterfly alone. This was elaborated ingeniously
in The <i>Gentle Art of Making Enemies</i>, the Butterfly not
only decorating, but punctuating the paragraphs. Rumour says that
Whistler went so far as to sign his cheques with the Butterfly, and
that once, having signed a cheque for thirty-two francs in this manner,
the man to whom it was paid demanded a more conventional signature.
Whistler, provoked by the suggestion of doubt, wrote his name, knowing
the bank would not then accept it, and was more provoked when he
found the rare autograph had been sold within a day for eleven hundred
and fifty francs. But rumour is probably wrong: on all the formal
letters and documents we have seen, his name, and not the Butterfly,
is used.</p>

<p>On the frames of early pictures Japanese patterns were painted
in red or blue on the flat gold, and a Butterfly placed on them, in relation
to the picture. He designed the frames, and they were carried out
by the Greaves, who also copied his designs at Streatham Town Hall,
which they decorated thirty years later. Shortly before his death, a
few were done by his stepson, E. Godwin. The <i>Sarasate</i>, in Pittsburg,
is an excellent example, and so is the <i>Battersea Bridge</i> at the Tate
Gallery. Whistler applied a similar scheme to his etchings, water-colours,
and pastels, reddish or bluish lines, and at times the Butterfly,
appearing on the white or gold of their frames. Certain people want
to make out that Whistler got the idea from Rossetti. It might as well
be said that Rossetti got it from the beginning of the world. There is
nothing new in the idea. Artists always have decorated special frames
for special pictures, and Whistler only carried on tradition when he
designed frames in harmony with his work and varied them according
to the pictures for which they were used. In after years he gave
up almost entirely these painted frames, and for his paintings substituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
a simple gold frame, with parallel reeded lines, now universally
known as "the Whistler frame." For his etchings and lithographs he
chose a plain white frame in two planes. His canvases and his panels
were always of the same sizes; consequently they always fitted his
frames. And in his studio, as in few, if any others, frequently there
might be half a hundred canvases with their faces to the wall, and
only half a dozen frames. But they all fitted, and Whistler never
showed his work unframed. This was the outcome of Japanese
influence, and of his knowledge of the way the Japanese display their
art. His deference to Japanese convention went so far that he put
a branch of a tree or a reed into the foreground of his seas and rivers
as decoration, in early work, with no reference to the picture, sometimes
the only Japanese suggestion in the design.</p>

<p><i>The Lange Leizen&mdash;of the Six Marks</i> went to the Academy of
1864, with <i>Wapping</i>. The critic of the <i>Athenæum</i>, to whom the
Japanese subject seemed "quaint" and the drawing "preposterously
incorrect," could not deny the "superb colouring" and the "beautiful
harmonies," nor fail to see in Wapping an "incomparable view of
the Lower Pool of London." "Never before was that familiar scene
so triumphantly well painted," Mr. W. M. Rossetti wrote.</p>

<p>Whistler did not send to the <i>Salon</i> of 1864, in which Fantin showed
his now famous <i>Hommage à Delacroix</i>, who had died in 1863. Whistler
was among the several admirers whom Fantin painted round the
portrait of the dead master. Whistler wanted Fantin to find a place
for Rossetti, who would be proud to pose, and Fantin was willing, but
Rossetti could not get to Paris. There was also talk of including
Swinburne. Unfortunately for both, they were left out of one of
the most celebrated portrait groups of modern times, now in the
Moreau-Nélaton Collection in the Louvre. The distinguished artists
and men of letters were there nominally out of respect to Delacroix,
but really to enable Fantin to justify his belief in the beauty of life as it
is, and his protest against the classical dictionary and studio properties.
Most of them were, or have since become, famous: Whistler, Manet,
Legros, Bracquemond, Fantin, Baudelaire, Duranty, Champfleury,
Cordier, De Balleroy. Fantin painted them in the costume of the
time, as Rembrandt and Hals and Van der Helst, from whom he is
said to have taken the idea, painted the regents and archers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
seventeenth-century Holland. Fantin's white shirt is the one concession
to picturesqueness, and the one relief to the severity of detail are the
flowers held by Whistler, a lithe, erect, youthful figure, with fine, keen
face and abundant hair. That the young American should be the
centre of the group was a distinction. When Rossetti saw the picture,
he wrote to his brother that it had "a great deal of very able painting
in parts, but it is a great slovenly scrawl after all, like the rest of this
incredible new school."</p>

<p>Whistler was already working out of the artificial scheme of the
Japanese pictures into a phase in which he was more himself than he
had ever been. The next year, 1865, he sent to the Academy the
most complete, the most perfect picture he ever painted, <i>The Little
White Girl</i>, which will always be recognised as one of the few great
pictures of the world. It was dated 1864, and there are reproductions
showing the date. But about 1900 he painted it out. He had been
working on the picture, he told us, and "did not see the use of those
great figures sprawling there." Jo was the model. Now, there was
no masquerading in foreign finery. Whistler painted her as he must
often have seen her, in her simple white gown, leaning against the
mantel, her beautiful face reflected in the mirror. The room was
not littered with his purchases from the little shops in the Strand and
the Rue de Rivoli. Japan is in the detail of blue and white on the
mantel; the girl holds a Japanese fan; a spray of azalea trails across
her dress. But these were part of Whistler's house, part of the
reality he had created for himself, and he made them no more beautiful
than the mantel, the grate, the reflection in the mirror. There was
no building up, he painted what he saw. And there was in the
handling an advance. The paint is thinner on the canvas, the brush
flows more freely.</p>

<p>Swinburne saw the picture and wrote <i>Before the Mirror: Verses
under a Picture</i>. The poem was printed on gold paper, pasted on the
frame, which has disappeared, but we have a contemporary photograph
showing the arrangement, and two verses were inserted in the
Academy catalogue as sub-title. What Swinburne thought of the
picture may be read in a letter he wrote to Ruskin in the summer
of 1865 (<i>Library Edition of the Works of Ruskin</i>), in which he says
that many, especially Dante Rossetti, told him his verses were better
than the painting, and that Whistler ranked them far above it. But
a closer examination of the picture only convinced him of its greater
beauty, and he would stand up for Whistler against Whistler and everybody
else.</p>

<p>Swinburne's poem and praise could not make <i>The Little White
Girl</i> at the Academy better understood than <i>The White Girl</i> had been
in Berners Street. The rare few could appreciate its "charm" and
"exquisiteness" with Mr. W. M. Rossetti, who found that it was
"crucially tested by its proximity to the flashing white in Mr. Millais'
<i>Esther</i>," but that it stood the test, "retorting delicious harmony
for daring force, and would shame any other contrast." But the
general opinion was the other way. The <i>Athenæum</i> distinguished
itself by regretting that Whistler should make the "most 'bizarre'
of bipeds" out of the women he painted. There was praise for two
other pictures. "Subtle beauty of colour" and "almost mystical
delicacy of tone" were discovered in <i>The Gold Screen</i>, and "colour
such as painters love" in the <i>Old Battersea Bridge</i>, afterwards <i>Brown
and Silver</i>. This is the beautiful Battersea, with the touch of red
in the roofs of the opposite shore, the link between the early paintings
on the river and the Nocturnes that were to follow. <i>The Scarf</i>, a
picture we do not recognise, attracted less attention, and Whistler,
the year before, declared "one of the most original artists of the day"
was now dismissed as one who "might be called half a great artist."</p>

<p>Stranger than this was the change in the attitude of the French
critics. In 1863 they overwhelmed him with praise. Two years
later they had hardly a good word for him. Levi Legrange, forgotten
as he merits, wrote the criticism of the Royal Academy of 1865 for the
<i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, and all he could see in <i>The Little White Girl</i>
was a weak repetition of <i>The White Girl</i>, a wearisome variation of
the theme of white; really, he said, it was quite witty of the Academicians,
who could have refused it and the two Japanese pictures, to
give them good places and so deliver them to judgment. And then
he praised Horsley and Prinsep, Leslie and Landseer. The <i>Princesse
du Pays de la Porcelaine</i>, in the <i>Salon</i>, made no more favourable
impression. It seemed a study of costume to Paul Mantz, who, in
the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, decided to forget it and remember merely
the mysterious seduction of <i>The White Girl</i> of two years before. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
eccentricity was only possible if taken in small doses like the hom&oelig;opathist's
pills, according to the incredible Jules Claretie, who, in the
same article in <i>L'Artiste</i>, laughed at Manet's <i>Olympia</i>. For more
than twenty years Whistler was hated in France.</p>

<p>In this <i>Salon</i>, 1865, Fantin showed his <i>Hommage à la Vérité&mdash;Le
Toast</i>, the second of his two large groups including Whistler's portrait.
In it he strayed so far from the real as to introduce an allegorical
figure of Truth, and to allow Whistler to array himself in a gorgeous
Chinese robe. "<i>Pense à la robe, superbe à faire, et donne la moi!</i>"
Whistler urged from London, and Fantin yielded. "<i>Je l'ai encore
revu dans l'atelier en 1865, il me posa dans un tableau aujourd'hui détruit,
'Le Toast,' où il était costumé d'une robe japonaise</i>," is Fantin's story
of it in the notes to us, but Whistler, writing at the time, speaks of
the costume as Chinese. He brought it to Paris for the sittings.
Fantin was quick to regret his concessions. An allegorical figure
could not be made real, the whole thing was absurd. When he got
the canvas back he destroyed it, all but the portraits of Whistler,
Vollon, and himself. Whistler's is now in the Freer Collection.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1865 Whistler was joined in London by his younger
brother. Dr. Whistler had distinguished himself in the Confederate
Army as a surgeon and by bravery in the field. He had served in
Richmond Hospitals and in Libby Prison; he had been assistant-surgeon
at Drewry's Bluff, and in 1864, when Grant made his move
against Richmond, he had been assigned to Orr's Rifles, a celebrated
South Carolina regiment. In the early winter of 1865 a few months'
furlough was given him, and he was entrusted by the Confederate
Government with important despatches to England. Sherman's
advance prevented his running the blockade from Charleston, nor was
there any passing through the lines from Wilmington by sea. He
was obliged to go North through Maryland, which meant making
his way round Grant's lines. The difficulties and dangers were endless.
He had to get rid of his Confederate uniform, and in the state of Confederate
finance the most modest suit of clothes cost fourteen hundred
dollars; for a seat in a waggon he had to pay five hundred. The
trains were crowded with officials and soldiers, and he could get a
ride in them only by stealth. The roads were abominable, for driving
or riding or walking. Often he was alone, and his one companion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
toward the North was a fellow soldier who had lost a leg at Antietam
and was trying to get to Philadelphia for repairs to an artificial one.
Stanton's expedition filled the country near the Rappahannock with
snares and pitfalls; to cross Chesapeake Bay was to take one's life
in one's hand; and north of the Bay were the enrolling officers of
the Union in search of conscripts. However, Philadelphia was at
last reached and a ticket for New York bought at the railroad depot,
where two sentries, with bayonets fixed, guarded the ticket-office,
and might, for all Dr. Whistler knew, have seen him in Libby Prison.
In New York he took passage on the <i>City of Manchester</i>, and from Liverpool
he hurried to London. One week later came the news of the fall
of Richmond and the Confederacy. The furlough was over. There
was no going back. It was probably about this time, from the costume
and the technical resemblance to Mr. Luke Ionides' portrait, that
Whistler painted a head of Dr. Whistler&mdash;<i>Portrait of my Brother</i>&mdash;now
owned by Mr. Burton Mansfield, though it should and might
have been in the National Gallery in Washington.</p>

<p>Early in September 1865, Whistler's mother was suffering from
trouble with her eyes, and went with her two sons to Coblentz to
consult an oculist, and this gave Whistler the chance to revisit some
of the scenes of the French Set of etchings. After that he spent
a month or two at Trouville, where he was joined by Courbet.
Whistler's work shows how far he had drifted away, though the two
were always friends. In <i>Sea and Rain</i>, done at Trouville, there is
not a suggestion of Courbet. But we have seen a sea by Courbet, owned
by M. Duret, that Whistler might have signed. Jo was there too.
The sea-pieces he had begun, including <i>Courbet on the Shore</i>, promised
great things, he wrote to Mr. Luke Ionides, and as the autumn went
on the place was more quiet for work, and the seas and skies more
wonderful. He did not get back to London until November. A
few months later, early in 1866, he sailed for Valparaiso.</p>

<p>This journey to Valparaiso is the most unaccountable adventure
in his sometimes unaccountable career. Various reasons for it have
been given: health, a quarrel, restlessness, a whim. But we tell the
story as he told it to us:</p>

<p>"It was a moment when many of the adventurers the war had
made of many Southerners were knocking about London hunting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
something to do, and, I hardly knew how, but the something resolved
itself into an expedition to go and help the Chilians and, I cannot
say why, the Peruvians, too. Anyhow, there were South Americans
to be helped against the Spaniards. Some of these people came to
me, as a West Point man, and asked me to join&mdash;and it was all done
in an afternoon. I was off at once in a steamer from Southampton
to Panama. We crossed the Isthmus, and it was all very awful&mdash;earthquakes
and things&mdash;and I vowed, once I got home, that nothing
would ever bring me back again.</p>

<p>"I found myself in Valparaiso and in Santiago, and I called on the
President, or whoever the person then in authority was. After that
came the bombardment. There was the beautiful bay with its curving
shores, the town of Valparaiso on one side, on the other the long line
of hills. And there, just at the entrance of the bay, was the Spanish
fleet, and, in between, the English fleet, and the French fleet, and
the American fleet, and the Russian fleet, and all the other fleets. And
when the morning came, with great circles and sweeps, they sailed
out into the open sea, until the Spanish fleet alone remained. It
drew up right in front of the town, and bang went a shell, and the
bombardment began. The Chilians didn't pretend to defend themselves.
The people all got out of the way, and I and the officials,
rode to the opposite hills, where we could look on. The Spaniards
conducted the performance in the most gentlemanly fashion; they
just set fire to a few of the houses, and once, with some sense of fun,
sent a shell whizzing over toward our hills. And then I knew what
a panic was. I and the officials turned and rode as hard as we could,
anyhow, anywhere. The riding was splendid, and I, as a West Point
man, was head of the procession. By noon the performance was over.
The Spanish fleet sailed again into position, the other fleets sailed in,
sailors landed to help put out the fires, and I and the officials rode
back into Valparaiso. All the little girls of the town had turned
out, waiting for us, and as we rode in called us 'Cowards!' The
<i>Henriquetta</i>, the ship fitted up in London, did not appear till long
after, and then we breakfasted, and that was the end of it."</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore Roussel says Whistler told him that, on another
occasion, he got on one of the defending gunboats and had his baptism
of fire amid a rain of shot and shell, and that then, as we have said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the white lock appeared, a fact which, fine as it is, Whistler omitted
from his story to us.</p>

<p>He made good use of his time in Valparaiso, and painted the three
pictures of the harbour which are known and two others which have
disappeared. These he gave to the steward or the purser of the ship
to bring home, and the purser kept them. Once they were seen in
his house in London by someone who recognised Whistler's work.
"Why, they must be by Whistler!" he said. "Who's Whistler?"
asked the purser. "An artist," said the other. "Oh, no," said the
purser, "they were painted by a gentleman." The purser started back
for South America, and took them with him. "And then a tidal wave
met the ship and swept off the purser, the cabin, and the Whistlers."
But we believe that one of these pictures is now in the United States.</p>

<p>The voyage back was vaguer than the voyage out. From this
vagueness looms one figure: the Marquis de Marmalade, a black man
from Hayti, who made himself obnoxious to Whistler, apparently
by his colour and his swagger. One day Whistler kicked him across
the deck to the top of the companion way, and there sat a lady who
proved an obstacle for the moment. But Whistler just picked up
the Marquis de Marmalade, dropped him on the step below her, and
finished kicking him downstairs. After that Whistler spent the rest
of the journey, not exactly in irons, but chiefly in his cabin.</p>

<p>The final adventure of the journey was in London. Whistler
never told us, but everybody else says that when he got out of the
train at Euston, or Waterloo, someone besides his friends was waiting:
whether the captain of the ship, or relations of the Marquis de
Marmalade, or an old enemy makes little difference. Somebody got
a thrashing, and this was the end to the most unaccountable episode
in Whistler's life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII: CHELSEA DAYS CONTINUED.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN SIXTY-SIX TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-TWO.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in 1866 when Whistler returned from Valparaiso. Soon
after he moved into No. 2,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> at the east end of Lindsey Row, now</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 96 Cheyne Walk. It was a three-storey house with an attic, part
of the old palace remodelled, and, like No. 7, it looked on the river.
Here he lived longer than anywhere else; here he painted the
Nocturnes and the great portraits; here he gave his Sunday breakfasts.
He had a house-warming on February 5 (1867), when the two
Rossettis dined with him, and Mr. W. M. Rossetti wrote in his diary:</p>

<p>"There are some fine old fixtures, such as doors, fireplaces, and
Whistler has got up the rooms with many delightful Japanesisms.
Saw for the first time his pagoda cabinet. He has two or three sea-pieces
new to me: one, on which he particularly lays stress, larger
than the others, a very grey unbroken sea [probably <i>Sea and Rain</i>],
also a clever vivacious portrait of himself begun."</p>

<p>No doubt this is the portrait in round hat, with paint-brushes
in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Greaves says that the dining-room at No. 2 was blue, with a
darker blue dado and doors, and purple Japanese fans tacked on the
walls and ceiling; other friends remember "a fluttering of purple
fans." One evening Miss Chapman was dining, and Whistler, wanting
her to see the view up the river from the other end of the bridge, told
her he would show her something "as lovely as a fan!" The studio,
again the second-storey back room, was grey, with black dado and
doors; from the <i>Mother</i> and the <i>Carlyle</i> one knows that Japanese
hangings and his prints were on the walls; and in it was the big screen
he painted for Leyland but kept for himself, with Battersea Bridge
across the top, Chelsea Church beyond, and a great gold moon in the
deep blue sky. The stairs were covered with Dutch metal. He slept
in a huge Chinese bed. Beautiful silver was on his table. He ate off
blue and white. "Suppose one of these plates was smashed?" Miss
Chapman asked Whistler once. "Why, then, you know," he said,
"we might as well all take hands and go throw ourselves into the
Thames!"</p>

<p>The beauty of the decoration, as at No. 7, was its simplicity.
Rossetti's house was a museum, an antiquity shop, in comparison.
The simplicity seemed the more bewildering because it was the growth,
not of weeks, but of years. The drawing-room was not painted until
the day of Whistler's first dinner-party. In the morning he sent for
the brothers Greaves to help him. "It will never be dry in time!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
they feared. "What matter?" said Whistler, "it will be beautiful!"
"We three worked like mad," is Mr. Walter Greaves' account, and
by evening the walls were flushed with flesh-colour, pale yellow, and
white spread over doors and woodwork, and we have heard gowns
and coats too were touched with flesh-colour and yellow before the
evening was at an end. One Sunday morning Whistler, after he had
taken his mother to Chelsea Church, as he always did, again sent for
his pupils and painted a great ship with spreading sails in each of the
two panels at the end of the hall; the ships are said to be still on the
wall covered up. His mother was not so pleased when, on her return,
she saw the blue and white harmony, for she would have had him
put away his brushes on Sunday as once she put away his toys. But
she had many other trials and revelations: coming into the studio
one day, she found the parlour-maid posing for "the all-over!" The
ships were in place long before the dado of hall and stairway was
covered with gold and sprinkled with rose and white chrysanthemum
petals. Miss Alexander (Mrs. Spring-Rice) saw Whistler at work
upon it when she came to sit, and he had lived six years at No. 2.
Whistler's houses were never completely decorated and furnished;
they had a look as if he had just moved in or was just moving out.
But what was decorated was beautiful.</p>

<p>Whistler sent to the exhibitions of 1867, in London and Paris.
He began the year by showing at the French Gallery, in January,
one of the paintings of Valparaiso: <i>Crépuscule in Flesh Colour and
Green</i>. It is the long picture of Valparaiso Harbour in the early evening,
ships moored with partly furled sails; the first painting of twilight,
and one of the first paintings carried out in the liquid manner of the
Nocturnes. There were critics to call it a poem "in colour," though
Whistler had not taught them to look for the "painter's poetry"
in his work. The upright Valparaiso, a perfect Nocturne, was done
at the same time, 1866, but not exhibited until later, and there is an
unfinished version of the same subject.</p>

<p>In the <i>Salon</i> of 1867, where it had been rejected eight years before,
<i>At the Piano</i> was accepted, and also <i>The Thames in Ice&mdash;Sur la Tamise:
l'Hiver</i>. It was the year of the French Universal Exhibition. M. Duret
writes that probably Mr. George Lucas spoke of Whistler to Mr. Avery,
the United States Art Commissioner at the Exhibition. The result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was that a number of his etchings and four pictures were hung: <i>The
White Girl</i>, <i>Wapping or On the Thames</i>, <i>Old Battersea Bridge</i>, <i>Twilight
on the Ocean</i>, the title then of the <i>Crépuscule in Flesh Colour and Green</i>.
The Hudson River School dominated American art, and Whistler's
paintings had to compete with the big <i>machines</i> of Church and Bierstadt.
Tuckerman, in his <i>Book of the Artists</i>, quotes an unnamed American
critic who, in 1867, found that Whistler's etchings differed from his
paintings in meriting the attention they attracted, but he could see
in the <i>Marines</i> only "blurred, foggy imperfections," and in <i>The White
Girl</i> only "a powerful female with red hair, and a vacant stare in her
soulless eyes. She is standing on a wolfskin hearthrug, for what reason
is unrecorded. The picture evidently means vastly more than it expresses&mdash;albeit
expressing too much. Notwithstanding an obvious want
of purpose, there is some boldness in the handling, and singularity in the
glare of the colours which cannot fail to divert the eye and weary it."</p>

<p>Americans were not treated with respect by the Hanging Committee.
Their work was put in corridors and dark corners, and Whistler suffered.
French critics, enthusiastic over his pictures four years earlier, were
now no more appreciative than the American. Paul Mantz was
distressed by the "strange white apparition" upon which, at the
<i>Salon des Refusés</i>, he had lavished his praise. Burty thought that
either time exaggerated the defects of the prints or else critical eyes
had lost their indulgence, for the etchings were photographic and had
a dryness and minuteness due to the early training of "Mr. Whystler."
Both wrote in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>. Mr. Avery, however, had
the sense to appreciate the etchings, and it was probably at this time he
commenced his great collection, now in the New York Public Library.</p>

<p>Whistler and his brother, the Doctor, went to Paris in April.
There they heard of the sudden death of Traer, Seymour Haden's
assistant, and a member of the British Jury, on which Haden also
served. Whistler liked Traer, and the circumstances of his death and
burial led to a misunderstanding between the two brothers and the
brother-in-law. The three met. The dispute was short and sharp;
the result, a summons for the brothers to appear before a <i>juge de
paix</i>. Whistler had been in the same court a few days earlier. A
workman had dropped plaster on him as he passed through a narrow
street in the Latin Quarter, and he had met the offence in the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
way possible according to his code. Whistler sent for the American
Minister, and the magistrate apologised. When he appeared again,
"<i>Connu!</i>" said the judge, and there was no apology, but a fine. Haden
said he fell through a plate-glass window, Whistler that he knocked
him through. Haden maintained that both brothers were against
him, Whistler that he demolished Haden single-handed.</p>

<p>It happened just when London gossip got hold of the story of the
Marquis de Marmalade and Whistler's return from Valparaiso. Dr.
Moncure Conway, in his <i>Reminiscences</i>, recalls a dinner given by Dante
Rossetti to W. J. Stillman, in the winter of 1867, when "Whistler
(a Confederate) related with satisfaction his fisticuff with a Yankee
[really the black Marquis] on shipboard, William Rossetti remarked:
'I must say, Whistler, that your conduct was scandalous.' (Stillman
and myself were silent.) Dante Gabriel promptly wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i1"><i>"There's a combative Artist named Whistler</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Who is, like his own hog-hairs, a bristler:</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>A tube of white lead</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>And a punch on the head</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Offer varied attractions to Whistler.'"</i></div>
<br /></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was at this time, too, that Whistler had a difference with Legros,
to which no reference would be made had it not also become a legend.
Friends tried to reconcile them and succeeded badly. The rumours
spread, and Whistler began to be talked of as quarrelsome. Haden,
when he got back to London, resigned his post as Honorary Surgeon
to South Kensington Museum, printed a pamphlet to explain, and
threatened to resign from the Burlington Fine Arts Club, of which
both he and Whistler were members, unless Whistler was expelled.
The Burlington Club wrote to Whistler that if he did not resign they
would have to consider his expulsion. Both the Rossettis considered
this very improper, and when Whistler's expulsion was voted by
eighteen against eight, William Michael Rossetti handed in his resignation
at once and Dante Rossetti sent in his two or three days
later.</p>

<p>Whistler's manner of resenting injury had a great deal to do with
the way he was later treated in England. He explained his code to
a friend: "If a man gives you the lie to your face, why, naturally you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hit him." People who did not know him became afraid of him, and
this fear grew and was the reason of the reputation that clung to him
for years and clings to his memory.</p>

<p>Before Whistler's pictures went to the Royal Academy, Mr. W. M.
Rossetti saw them: "<i>March 31</i> (1867). To see Whistler's pictures
for the R.A. To the R.A. he means to send <i>Symphony in White,
No. III.</i> (heretofore named <i>The Two Little White Girls</i>), and a Thames
picture; possibly also one of the four sea pictures; and I rather
recommend him to select the largest of these, which he regards with
predilection, of a grey sea and a very grey sky."</p>

<p><i>Battersea</i> was the Thames picture; <i>Sea and Rain</i>, painted while
Whistler and Courbet worked together at Trouville, the sea picture;
and <i>The Two Little White Girls</i> was sent under its new name, <i>Symphony
in White, No. III.</i>&mdash;the first time one of his pictures was catalogued
as a Symphony, his first use of a title borrowed from musical terms
to explain his pictorial intention.</p>

<p>Baudelaire had given the hint in prose, Gautier had written
<i>Symphonies</i> in verse, Murger's Bohemians had composed a <i>Symphonie
sur l'influence de bleu dans les arts</i>. In 1863 Paul Mantz had described
<i>The White Girl</i> as a "Symphony in White." There can be no doubt
that from these things Whistler got the idea. It was the third variation
of white upon white. The difference was in the thin liquid paint.
The critic of the <i>Athenæum</i> had the sense to thank the "painter who
endeavours by any means to show people what he really aims at."
But he was almost alone. Burty, in noticing the Academy of 1867
for the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, thought the Academy's hanging
Whistler at all a fine piece of irony, and regretted the painter's failure
to fulfil his early promise.</p>

<p>Hamerton, in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, June 1, 1867, represented the
feeling of the insulted, solemn, bewildered Islanders: "There are
many dainty varieties of tint, but it is not precisely a symphony
in white. One lady has a yellowish dress and brown hair and a bit
of blue ribbon; the other has a red fan, and there are flowers and
green leaves. There is a girl in white on a white sofa, but even
this girl has reddish hair; and, of course, there is the flesh-colour of
the complexions."</p>

<p>Whistler answered in a letter, not printed, however, until it appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
in the <i>Art Journal</i> (April 1887): "<i>Bon Dieu!</i> did this wise person
expect white hair and chalked faces? And does he then, in his
astounding consequence, believe that a symphony in F contains no other
note, but shall be a continued repetition of F F F?... Fool!"</p>

<p>Whistler knew that to carry on tradition was the artist's business.
Rembrandt, Hals, Velasquez, Claude, Canaletto, Guardi, Hogarth,
Courbet, the Japanese, in turn influenced him. Some see, at this
period, the influence of Albert Moore, which, if it existed, was as
ephemeral and superficial as Rossetti's. It could be argued with more
truth that Whistler influenced Albert Moore, who, in at least two
pictures, <i>Harmony of Orange and Pale Yellow</i>, <i>Variation of Blue and
Gold</i>, borrowed Whistler's titles. Whistler also knew that the end of
all study of the masters should be to evolve something personal, and,
in the endeavour to develop his personality, he was passing through
experiments and working through difficulties. All this is in his letters
to Fantin. A fourth <i>Symphony in White</i> was started: the <i>Three
Figures</i>. In the <i>Two Girls</i>, he wrote to Fantin, the harmony was
repeated in line and in colour, and he sent a sketch of it. He exulted
in the rhythm of line; he despaired because he could not get it right.
The picture was scraped out and rubbed down, then repainted, and
with each fresh difficulty he deplored the mistakes of his early training.
Mr. Eddy writes that Whistler used to call Ingres the "<i>bourgeois</i>
Greek." This we never heard him say, nor is there any such want of
respect in his letters to Fantin, for there he expresses regret that he
"did not study under Ingres," whose work he may have liked moderately,
"but from whom I would have learned to draw": which was
absurd modesty, for he drew better than Ingres, if not so academically,
as his etchings prove. He never execrated Courbet and denounced <i>ce
damné Réalisme</i> so violently as in the autumn of 1867. This was not
quite fair, for Realism had brought Courbet to the conclusions which
Whistler, unaided, was now reaching: that knowledge of art, ancient
and modern, has no end save the development of individuality, and
that the artist is to go to Nature for inspiration, but to take from her
only life and beauty. Whistler, in his impatience, recalled Realism
as practised by the young enthusiasts gathered about Courbet, and
denied that Courbet influenced him. "<i>Ca ne pouvait pas être autrement,
parce que je suis très personnel, et que j'ai été riche en qualités qu'il n'avait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
pas et qui me suffisaient.</i>" The cry of Nature had appealed to his vanity,
Whistler said, and so he had mocked at tradition, and in his early
work had copied Nature with the self-confidence of "<i>l'écolier débauché</i>."
If at one moment he boasted that the race was for Fantin and himself,
because in art, as at the Derby, "<i>c'est le pur sang qui gagné</i>," the next
he chafed over the time he had lost before discovering that art is not
the exact reproduction of Nature, but its interpretation, and that
the artist must seek his motives in Nature and weave from them a
pattern on his canvas. He praised Fantin's flowers because he saw
in them this pattern. Passages in the letters are the basis of <i>The Ten
O'Clock</i>. His definition of the relation of drawing to colour&mdash;"<i>son
amant, mais aussi son maître</i>"&mdash;suggests the later definition of the
relation of the artist to Nature: "her son in that he loves her, her
master in that he knows her." Whistler used the same ideas in his
talk, in his letters, in his pamphlets, perfecting it.</p>

<p>It was the period of transition. Those who saw him know how hard
he worked, and how he was discouraged. For a while he lived with
Mr. Frederick Jameson. He never spoke to us of this interval away
from Lindsey Row. Mr. Jameson says it was 1868 or 1869; most
likely the winter of 1867-68, when Mrs. Whistler went home to visit
her family, left poor by the war. Mr. Jameson lived at 62 Great Russell
Street, Bloomsbury, in rooms that had first been Burne-Jones', and
afterwards Poynter's. Mr. Jameson writes us:</p>

<p>"The seven months Whistler and I lived together were unproductive
and uneventful. He was working at some Japanese pictures,
one of which, quite unfinished, was hung at the London Memorial
Exhibition. I have seen large portions of it apparently finished, but
they never satisfied him, and were shaved down to the bed-rock mercilessly.
The man, as I knew him, was so different from the descriptions
and presentations I have read of him that I would like to speak of the
other side of his character. It is impossible to conceive of a more
unfailingly courteous, considerate, and delightful companion than
Whistler, as I found him. We lived in great intimacy, and the studio
was always open to me, whatever he was doing. We had all our meals
together, except when elsewhere engaged, and I never heard a complaint
of anything in our simple household arrangements from him. Any
little failure was treated as a joke. His courtesy to servants and models
was particularly charming; indeed, I can't conceive of his quarrelling
with anyone without real provocation. His talk about his own work
revealed a very different man to me from the self-satisfied man he is
usually believed to have been. He knew his powers, of course, but
he was painfully aware of his defects&mdash;in drawing, for instance. I
can remember with verbal accuracy some very striking talks we had
on the subject. To my judgment he was the most absolutely truthful
man about himself that I ever met. I never knew him to hide an opinion
or a thought, nor to try to excuse an action."</p>

<p>The picture Mr. Jameson refers to was called <i>Three Figures, Pink
and Grey</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in the London Memorial Exhibition. It alone was carried
out of the <i>Six</i> or <i>Eight Schemes</i> or <i>Projects</i> in which Whistler was trying
to combine Japanese and classical motives, expressing a beauty of form
and design that haunted him, and was perhaps best realised in some
of the pastel studies. He never ceased to make these studies. There
are pastels, chalk drawings, and etchings in which the separate figures
of the <i>Projects</i> may be found, studies for the series; one was worked
out as a fan, another like a cameo. The second version of the <i>Three
Figures</i>, enlarged from a smaller design, Whistler explained to Mr.
Alan S. Cole, was an arrangement he wanted to paint, and he then
drew, with a sweep of the brush, the back of the stooping figure to
show what he meant. W. M. Rossetti most likely referred to it when
he wrote in his diary for July 28, 1867:</p>

<p>"Whistler is doing on a largish scale for Leyland the subject of
women with flowers, and has made coloured sketches of four or five
other subjects of the like class, very promising in point of conception
of colour and arrangement."</p>

<p>The <i>Projects</i> were his first scheme of decoration for Leyland. The
canvases are about the same size. They are painted with liquid
colour, the canvas often showing through. The handling in all save
the <i>Venus</i>, shown in the Paris Memorial Exhibition and worked on
in his later years, is more direct than anything he ever did. They
have the same relation to his pictures as the sketches of Rubens and
Tiepolo to their decorations. The <i>Venus</i> is a single figure, the rest
are groups arranged against a balustrade, round a vase of flowers, or
on the sands by the sea. Their floating draperies give the scheme of</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>colour. The experience gained in making these designs was of immense
use in the Nocturnes, for the technique is the same, and the same
treatment is in the pile of drapery of the <i>Miss Alexander</i>. He did
not give up until much later this method of painting. The complete
series had never been seen publicly before the Paris Memorial
Exhibition. They belong to Mr. Freer.</p>

<p>During all his life, till he was given a commission for a panel in
the Boston Public Library, Whistler hoped to have the chance to
execute a great decorative scheme. When the Central Gallery at the
Victoria and Albert Museum was being decorated, Sir Henry Cole asked
him to design one of the mosaic panels. For this, in the winter of 1873,
he made a pastel, a richly robed figure carrying a Japanese umbrella.
The scheme was in blue, purple, and gold, and a pastel study for it was
shown at the London Memorial Exhibition as <i>Design for a Mosaic</i>. He
spoke of it at the time as <i>The Gold Girl</i>. The design was to be enlarged
and put on canvas by the brothers Greaves. Sir Henry Cole offered
him a studio in the Museum when he was ready to begin his cartoon.
"You know, Sir Henry Cole always liked me, and I told him he ought
to provide me with a fine studio&mdash;it would be an honour to me&mdash;and
to the Museum!" But models broke down, the fog settled over
London, he wanted to get through his Academy picture, he was called
to Paris. Whether the cartoon was finished, or whether it was found
out of keeping with the <i>machines</i> of Royal Academicians in the Central
Gallery, is not known. But the decoration was never done.</p>

<p>Hamerton's <i>Etching and Etchers</i> was published in 1868. Shortly
before, he wrote to Whistler: "I wonder whether you would object
to lend me a set of proofs for a few weeks. As the book is already
advanced I should be glad of an early reply. My opinion of your work
is, on the whole, so favourable that your reputation could only gain by
your affording me the opportunity of speaking of your work at length."</p>

<p>Whistler took no notice of the request at the time, but printed it
years afterwards as the <i>Unanswered Letter</i> in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. Hamerton,
unused to being ignored by artists, expressed his astonishment in his
book: "I have been told that, if application is made by letter to
Mr. Whistler for a set of his etchings, he may, perhaps, if he chooses to
answer the letter, do the applicant the favour to let him have a copy
for about the price of a good horse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>His praise was never without qualification. He saw in Whistler
a strikingly imperfect artist, self-concentrated, without range or poetical
feeling, whose work was rarely affecting, and most of these remarks
were reprinted by Whistler with the <i>Unanswered Letter</i> as <i>Inconsequences</i>.
In the end Whistler let Hamerton have a plate, <i>Billingsgate</i>,
in its third state, published in the <i>Portfolio</i> (January 1878), and, two
years after, in the third edition of <i>Etching and Etchers</i> (1880).</p>

<p>Hamerton, patronising in his estimate of Whistler's work, exaggerated
in his comments on Whistler's prices. Success never induced
Whistler deliberately to increase the price of his etchings by making
them rare, in the fashion of the young men of to-day. It was different
with his dry-points, the number of impressions being limited. Mr. Percy
Thomas says that Whistler would throw them on the floor at Lindsey
Row and consider them. "I think for this we must say five guineas,
and for this six, and for this I must say&mdash;ten!" But Mr. Thomas
remembers only one attempt to create a price. He had been sent
from Bond Street to Lindsey Row with prints for Whistler to sign,
and the next day he returned for them. Whistler and Mrs. Whistler
were sitting together, silent and sad, and Whistler hurried from the
studio without a word. "But what is it? What has happened?"
Mr. Thomas asked, and Mrs. Whistler explained that Whistler had
thrown the prints into the fire, thinking it would be a good thing
to make them rare, and had been miserable since. If he destroyed
work he was sure to regret it. "<i>J'ai tant pleuré après</i>," as he wrote
to Fantin. Another incident remembered by Mr. Thomas would
have altered Hamerton's idea of Whistler's business methods. Edmund
Thomas had gone to the studio and offered a sum for all the prints
in it. Whistler accepted the offer, Mr. Thomas drew a cheque, and
carried off the prints. A couple of hours later a messenger appeared
with a bundle of proofs. Whistler had come upon them, and sent word
that, according to the bargain, they belonged to Mr. Thomas.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixties, or beginning of the seventies,
Mr. Murray Marks tried to start a Fine Art Company with Alexander
Ionides, Rossetti, Burne-Jones, and Morris to deal in pictures, prints,
blue and white, and decorative work. They were to sell Watts',
Burne-Jones', and Rossetti's pictures, and Whistler's etchings, possibly
his paintings. Ionides, who was to advance two or three thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
pounds, bought the sixteen plates by Whistler now known as the
Thames Set, and the prints from them. The sum paid was three
hundred pounds. A secretary was engaged for the company, but
that was the end of it. The plates became the absolute property
of Ionides. He had a hundred sets printed; he gave one set to each
of his children; the others were taken over by Messrs. Ellis and Green,
and published in 1871 as <i>Sixteen Etchings of Scenes on the Thames</i>,
price twelve guineas. Later, the plates came into the possession of
the Fine Art Society, who sold the prints unsigned as a set in a portfolio
for fourteen guineas, or, singly, from half a guinea to two guineas and
a half. Finally Mr. Keppel, of New York, bought the coppers, had
the steel facing removed, for they had been steeled, Goulding printed
a number from each, and some good prints were obtained. The plates
were then destroyed.</p>

<p>Official recognition of Whistler, the etcher, continued. The British
Museum bought his prints and only stopped when, some years ago,
it was discovered that the work of living artists could not be purchased
for the Print Room. The ignorance of this regulation was of value
to the Museum, where there are now one hundred and nine etchings by
Whistler. At the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington,
there are sixty-one prints, besides several issued in various publications
and a second Thames Set in the Ionides Collection. For several years
the late Sir Richard R. Holmes purchased prints for Windsor Castle
Library, about one hundred and forty in all. He wrote us:</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say when, or how, I first began collecting Whistler's
etchings. I had a few, and then I met several while I was looking
after other things at Thibaudeau's, and, gradually, I found I had so
many that I thought it best to make the collection as complete as I
could, and got a number from Whistler himself."</p>

<p>Often Sir Richard went to the studio; often Whistler sent to
Windsor prints he thought should be there. The Venetian series
was bought. Finally, after Sir Richard's retirement, they were sold
"to improve the collection" at what was supposed the height of
the "Whistler boom," and after they had been praised in the Memorial
Exhibitions of London and Paris. As King Edward VII. on his visit
to the London Memorial Exhibition expressed surprise at the few he
looked at, it is certain that his Majesty was unaware that the collection
was at Windsor. Even the portfolio, presented by Whistler to Queen
Victoria with his autograph letter asking her acceptance, was first
lost, and, when found, sold in 1906, the few prints in Princess Victoria's
apartments only being kept. The disposal of the etchings was so badly
managed that the Jubilee series brought more, when re-sold a few
weeks after the King parted with them, than his Majesty got for the
whole collection. During Whistler's lifetime important collections of
his etchings were acquired also by the Museums of Dresden, Venice,
and Melbourne, and the New York Public Library.</p>

<p>The success of Whistler's plates during the following years is a
contrast to the fate of his pictures, which for a long period were
neglected. He had nothing in the Academy of 1868. Mr. Jameson
has told us of his despair because the <i>Three Girls</i> was not finished in
time, and of their wandering together about town, in and out of galleries
and museums, until at last, before Velasquez in the National Gallery,
Whistler took heart again. And he delighted in the admiration of
Swinburne in <i>Notes on Some Pictures of 1868</i>. The paintings which
had not been submitted "to the loose and slippery judgment of an
academy," but had been seen by Swinburne in the studio and seemed
to him "to have grown as a flower grows," were evidently the <i>Projects</i>.
A special quality of Whistler's genius, Swinburne said, is "a freshness
and fullness of the loveliest life of things, with a high, clear power
upon them which seems to educe a picture as the sun does a blossom
or a fruit."</p>

<p>In 1869 the Academy moved to Burlington House, and there in
1870 Whistler showed <i>The Balcony</i>. From 1867 to 1870 he did not
show in the <i>Salon</i>. Whistler, like Rossetti, was never without his
public, though many years passed before he received Rossetti's rewards.
He could rely on the Ionides, Leathart, Frederick Leyland, Huth,
Alexander, Rawlinson, Anderson Rose, Jameson, Chapman, Potter.
But, unlike Rossetti, he wanted to show his work and receive for it
rewards. As far back as 1864 Fantin wrote to Edwin Edwards of
Whistler's perseverance, his determination to get into the <i>Salon</i>, a phase
of his character Fantin said he had not known. Whistler's absence
from exhibitions was not his fault. It was his hatred of rejection and
fear of being badly hung that drove him from them.</p>

<p>The tyranny of the Academy was no new thing. The opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of the exhibition was every year the occasion of scandal and of protest
against an institution that rejected and still rejects distinguished
artists. One gallery after another took up the outsiders. After the
Berners Street Gallery came the Dudley, which, in 1867, added to its
show of water-colours a show of oils; in 1868, the Corinthian Gallery
in Argyll Street; in 1869, the Select Supplementary Exhibition in
Bond Street&mdash;these last two poor affairs more apt to justify than expose
the Academy. Dealers came to the rescue: the French Gallery in
Pall Mall, and the Society of French Artists, where Durand-Ruel
brought his collection in 1870, and, under the management of M. Charles
Deschamps, gave exhibitions until 1877. In the French Gallery and
with M. Deschamps Whistler showed many times. He contributed
often to the Dudley from 1871, and there the next year, 1872, exhibited
for the first time a <i>Nocturne</i>. His use of titles to explain his intention
was now so well established that in 1872, when <i>The White Girl</i> and
the <i>Princesse</i> were in the International Exhibition at South Kensington,
they were catalogued as <i>Symphony in White, No. 1.</i>, and <i>Variations in
Flesh Colour, Blue, and Grey</i>, later changed to <i>Grey and Rose</i>; and he
supplied the explanation, printed in the "Programme of Reception."
They were "the complete results of harmonies obtained by employing
the infinite tones and variations of a limited number of
colours."</p>

<p>His portrait of his mother was sent to the Academy of 1872&mdash;<i>Arrangement
in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Painter's Mother</i>.
It was refused. Madox Brown wrote to George Rae: "I hear
that Whistler has had the portrait of his mother turned out. If so,
it is a shame, because I saw the picture, and know it to be good and
beautiful, though, I suppose, not to the taste of Messrs. Ansdell and
Dobson."</p>

<p>Sir William Boxall threatened to resign from the Council if the
portrait was not hung, for he would not have it said that a committee
to which he belonged had rejected it. Similar threats have been heard
in recent years, and the rejected work has stayed out, and the Academicians
have stayed in. Boxall would not yield, and the picture was
hung, not well, yet not out of sight; groups, it is said, were always
gathered before it to laugh. Still, there it was, the last picture by
Whistler at the Academy, where nothing of his was again seen, save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
one etching in 1879: <i>Putney Bridge</i>, published by the Fine Art Society
and probably sent by them.</p>

<p>The whole affair made talk. But 1872 is interesting, above all,
as the year when Whistler first exhibited a portrait as an <i>Arrangement</i>
and an impression of night as a <i>Nocturne</i>.</p>

<p>As it was the last year he showed a picture in the Academy, it may
be as well to complete here our account of his relations with this
institution. It is said that he put his name down, or allowed it to
be put down, for election. He was never elected. Other Americans
were, for the Royal Academy is so broad in its constitution that an
artist need not be an Englishman, need not be resident in Great Britain,
need not have shown on its walls to become a member or honorary
member. But though during all these years and until the day of his
death Whistler would have accepted election, we have never heard
that he obtained a single vote. George Boughton, an American
artist and a member of the Royal Academy, explained the Academic
attitude when he said that if Whistler had "behaved himself" he
would have been President. Even this concession Boughton qualified:
"Now, if anyone knowing Whistler and me should go about thinking
me serious in imagining that he would make a good President&mdash;even
of an East End boxing club&mdash;such persons live in dense error."</p>

<p>The only comment to make is that Boughton did not understand
Whistler, and, in company with the Academy, had not the least artistic
sense, or even business appreciation in this matter.</p>

<p>Whistler would have accepted election for one reason only&mdash;because
of the official rank it would have given him in England. Other Americans
hustled to get it; he expected it as an honour which he deserved. He
knew himself to be more distinguished than any member of the Royal
Academy. Though recognition was withheld during his lifetime,
several Academicians attempted to secure for the Academy a posthumous
glory by endeavouring to get together an exhibition of his works
the winter after his death. It would, indeed, have been irony if the
Academy had, in return for its neglect of Whistler, got the <i>kudos</i> and
cash as their reward. Another instance of what Americans call
"graft" is in the absence from the Chantrey Collection of a picture
by Whistler, and the presence of the work of the Academicians who
administer the Fund. The Trustees, although they have bought their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
own work, paying as much as one thousand pounds to Sir Edward J.
Poynter, three thousand to Sir Hubert von Herkomer, three thousand
and fifty to Lord Leighton, two thousand to Sir J. E. Millais, Bart.,
over two thousand to Mr. Frank Dicksee, two thousand to Sir W. Q.
Orchardson, two thousand to Vicat Cole, who are or were members of
the Council of the Academy, never even offered the sixty pounds for
which they might have bought Whistler's <i>Nocturne in Blue and Gold:
Old Battersea Bridge</i>, since purchased for two thousand by public
subscription and given to the Tate Gallery. Is it any wonder that
Whistler, disgusted with such conduct, especially on the part of his
fellow countrymen, members of the Academy, and others, who might
have elected him, left as his only written request relative to his pictures
we have seen, the wish that none should ever find a place in any
English Gallery? Death did not spare him Academical jealousy.
Not content with ignoring him during his lifetime, officially insulting
his memory after his death, Sir Edward Poynter, then Director, when
he hung <i>Old Battersea Bridge</i> in the National Gallery, affixed to it,
or allowed to be affixed, a label on which Whistler's name was misspelt,
Whistler described as of the British School, the title of the
picture incorrectly given, while Whistler's decorated frame was hung
upside down. The picture has since, by the irony of fate, been placed
in the Gallery of Modern British Art!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII: NOCTURNES.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-TWO TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> was the first to paint the night. The blue mystery that
veils the world from dusk to dawn is in the colour-prints of Hiroshige.
But the wood-block cannot give the depth of darkness, the method
makes a convention of colour. Hiroshige saw and felt the beauty and
invented a scheme by which to suggest it on the block, but he could not
render the night as Whistler rendered it on canvas.</p>

<p>Though colour-prints suggested the Nocturnes, they were only
the suggestion. Whistler never copied Japanese technique. But
Japanese composition impressed him&mdash;the arrangement, the pattern,
and at times the detail. The high or low horizon, the line of a bridge
over a river, the spray of foliage in the foreground, the golden curve
of a falling rocket, the placing of a figure on the shore, the signature in
the oblong panel, show how much he learned. He abandoned the
Japanese convention in a few years, but he never gave up, he developed
rather, what he always spoke of as the Japanese method of drawing.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
He translated Japanese art&mdash;translate is the word&mdash;though he said
that he "carried on tradition." His idea was not to go to the Japanese
as greater than himself, but to learn what he could from them and
make another work of art; a work founded on tradition no less than
theirs, and yet as Western as theirs was Eastern.</p>

<p>Night, beautiful everywhere from Valparaiso to Venice, is never
more beautiful than in London. First he painted the Thames in the
grey day, but, as time went on, he painted it in the blue night. Only
those who have lived by the river for years, as we have, can realise the
truth as well as the beauty of the Nocturnes. He still, like Courbet,
"loved things for what they were," but he chose the exquisite, the
poetic. The foolishness of Nature never appealed to him. But
Courbet was no more a realist than Whistler if realism means truth.</p>

<p>The long nights on the river were followed by long days in the
studio. In the end he gave up making notes. It was impossible for
him to work in colour at night, and he had to trust to his memory.
In his portraits and his pictures done by day he had a model. But
looking at colour and arrangement by night, and retaining the memory
until the next morning simply means a longer interval between
observation and execution. And, carrying on the tradition of the
Japanese and the method of drawing from memory advocated by
Lecoq de Boisbaudran, and practised by many of his most distinguished
contemporaries in France, Whistler developed his powers of observation.
Even then, as he said, to retain the memory of the subject required
as hard training as a football player goes through. His method was to
go out at night, and all his pupils or followers agree in this, stand before
his subject and look at it, then turn his back on it and repeat to whoever
was with him the arrangement, the scheme of colour, and as much of
the detail as he wanted. The listener corrected errors when they
occurred, and, after Whistler had looked long enough, he went to bed
with nothing in his head but his subject. The next morning, as he</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>told his apprentice, Mrs. Clifford Addams, if he could see upon the
untouched canvas the completed picture, he painted it; if not, he passed
another night in looking at the subject. However, it was not two
nights' observation alone, but the knowledge of a lifetime that enabled
him to paint the Nocturnes. This power to see a finished picture
on a bare canvas is possessed by all great artists. But the greater the
artist the more he sees and the better he presents it.</p>

<p>Whistler said "Nature put him out," because the arrangement as
he found it put him out; Nature is never right. Few painters have
understood the art of selection, and here Hiroshige and the other
Japanese were of use. He went to Nature for the motive, to the Japanese
for the design. This was why he said Nature was at once his master
and his servant. The Nocturnes looked so simple to a public trained
by Ruskin to believe that signs of labour are the chief merits in a
picture, that they seemed unfinished&mdash;just knocked off. Yet his letters
to Fantin are full of regret for his slowness: "<i>Je suis si lent....
Les choses ne vont pas vite.... Je produis peu parceque j'efface tout!</i>"
No one knew the hard work that produced the simplicity. In no other
paintings was Whistler as successful in following his own precepts and
concealing traces of toil. One touch less and nothing would be left;
one touch more and the spell would be broken, and night stripped of
mystery. To give the silhouette of bridge or building against the
sky; the lines of light trailing through the water or leading to infinite
distance; the boats, ghosts fading into the ghostly river; the fall of
rockets through shadowy air&mdash;to give all these things, and yet to keep
them shrouded in the transparency of darkness was the problem he
set himself in the Nocturnes painted in the little second-storey back
room at Chelsea. It was the night he saw and studied at Cremorne,
darker, more mysterious for the sudden flare of the fireworks, for the
glow in which little figures danced, for the hint of draperies passing
in and out of the shadows&mdash;night that toned the tawdry gardens and
their vulgar crowd into beauty.</p>

<p>Now everyone can see, and "night is like a Whistler," for Whistler
compelled people to look at his pictures, until it has become impossible
to look at night without seeing the Nocturnes. He painted the impression
that night made on him, and the great artist, like the great
author, moves people until they think they see things as he does. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in that ever-quoted passage from <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, he does not pretend
to see Nature as people see her or as Nature seems to be; his concern
is with the impression that Nature at night made on him, and in this
he was an impressionist.</p>

<p>The brothers Greaves bought his materials and prepared his canvas
and colours. "I know all these things because I passed days and weeks
in the place standing by him," Walter Greaves has said to us. Whistler
remade his brushes, heating them over a candle, melting the glue and
pushing the hair into the shape he wanted. Greaves says that the
colours were mixed with linseed oil and turpentine. Whistler told us
that he used a medium composed of copal, mastic, and turpentine.
The colours were arranged upon a palette, a large oblong board some
two feet by three, with the butterfly inlaid in one corner and sunken
boxes for brushes and tubes round the edges. This palette was laid
upon a table. He had at various periods two or three; and at least
one stand, with many tiny drawers, upon which the palette fitted.
At the top of the palette the pure colours were placed, though, more
frequently, there were no pure colours at all. Large quantities of
different tones of the prevailing colour in the picture to be painted
were mixed, and so much of the medium was used that he called it
"sauce." Greaves says that the Nocturnes were mostly painted on
a very absorbent canvas, sometimes on panels, sometimes on bare brown
holland, sized. For the blue Nocturnes, the canvas was covered with
a red ground, or the panel was of mahogany, which the pupils got from
their boat-building yard, the red forcing up the blues laid on it. Others
were done on a warm black, and for the fireworks there was a lead
ground. Or, if the night was grey, then, Whistler said, "the sky is grey,
and the water is grey, and, therefore, the canvas must be grey." Only
once within Greaves' memory was the ground white. The ground for
his Nocturnes, like the paper for his pastels, was chosen of the prevailing
tone of the picture he wanted to paint or of a colour which would give
him that tone, not to save work, but to avoid fatiguing the canvas.</p>

<p>When Whistler had arranged his colour-scheme on the palette,
the canvas, which the pupils prepared, was stood on an easel, but so
much "sauce" was used that frequently it had to be thrown flat on the
floor to keep the whole thing from running off. He washed the liquid
colour on, lightening and darkening the tones as he worked. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Nocturnes, the sky and water are rendered with great sweeps of the
brush of exactly the right tone. How many times he made and wiped
out that sweeping tone is another matter. When it was right, there it
stayed. With his life's knowledge of both the effects he wanted to paint
and the way to paint them, at times, as he admits himself, he completed
a Nocturne in a day. In some he got his effect at once, in others it
came only after endless failures. If the tones were right, he took them
off his palette and kept them until the next day, in saucers, or gallipots,
under water, so that he might carry on his work in the same way with
the same tones. Mrs. Anna Lea Merritt tells us that when she lived
in Cheyne Walk, she remembers "seeing the Nocturnes set out along
the garden wall to bake in the sun." Some were laid aside to dry slowly
in the studio, some were put in the garden or on the roof to dry quickly.
Sometimes they dried out like body-colour in the most unexpected
fashion. It was a time of tireless research. He had to invent everything,
though he profited by the technical training he had gained in
painting the <i>Six Projects</i>.</p>

<p>Whistler first called his paintings of night Moonlights. Nocturne
was Mr. Leyland's suggestion, as we have heard from Mrs. Leyland,
and her son-in-law, Val Prinsep, stated in the <i>Art Journal</i> (August
1892), that Whistler wrote to Leyland:</p>

<p>"I can't thank you too much for the name Nocturne as the title
for my Moonlights. You have no idea what an irritation it proves
to the critics, and consequent pleasure to me; besides it is really so
charming, and does so poetically say all I want to say and <i>no more</i> than
I wish."</p>

<p>Whether to mystify, or because he saw something new in his pictures,
Whistler repeatedly changed their titles, especially of the Nocturnes,
and repeatedly exhibited different pictures with the same title. It is
true, as Mr. Bernard Sickert writes: "such alterations made by the
artist himself stultify the whole idea, and prove that the analogy with
music does not hold consistently. Any musician would tell us that
we could not change the title of Symphony in C minor to Sonata in
G major without making it an absurdity."</p>

<p>That he should either not have realised this fact, or else have
disregarded it deliberately, is the more extraordinary because every
Nocturne represents a different effect rendered in a different fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Although he altered his titles, nothing offended him more than when
others tampered with them or stole them.</p>

<p>The painting of the Nocturnes continued for many years, and in
many places. But the greater number were painted when he lived at
Lindsey Row, most from his windows, and few took him beyond
Battersea and Westminster. He resented it when people suggested
literary titles for them, and he put his resentment into words that
"make history" in <i>The Red Rag</i>, one of the most interesting documents
in <i>The Gentle Art</i>, published originally in the <i>World</i> (May 22, 1878):</p>

<p>"My picture of a <i>Harmony in Grey and Gold</i> is an illustration
of my meaning&mdash;a snow scene with a single black figure and a lighted
tavern. I care nothing for the past, present, or future of the black
figure, placed there because the black was wanted at that spot. All
that I know is that my combination of grey and gold is the basis of
the picture. Now this is precisely what my friends cannot grasp.
They say, 'Why not call it "Trotty Veck," and sell it for a round
harmony of golden guineas?'"</p>

<p>Lord Redesdale told us that it was he who suggested this title,
gaily. Whistler assured another of his friends that he had only to write
"Father, dear Father, come home with me now" on the painting for
it to become the "picture of the year." Subject, sentiment, meaning
were for him in the night itself&mdash;the night in its loveliness and mystery.
There is no doubt that he carried tradition further and made
greater advance in the Nocturnes than in any of his paintings. The
subjects are the simplest&mdash;factories, bridges, boats and barges, shops,
gardens&mdash;but in his hands they became things of beauty that will live
for ever. The Nocturnes are not all moonlights; we remember only
a few in which the moon appears, some are illumined only by flickering
lamplight. They are not invariably pictures of night, but at times of
dawn or of twilight. Nocturnes, however, is the name Whistler chose
for all, and by it they will always be known.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV: PORTRAITS.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-ONE TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-FOUR.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Whistler was painting the Nocturnes, he was working on the
large portraits. The <i>Mother</i> was the first. We cannot say when he
began it. He wrote of it to Fantin, promising to send a photograph,
in 1871, but it was not shown until 1872. How many were the sittings,
how often the work was scraped down or wiped out, no one will ever
know. We have some interesting technical details from Walter Greaves.
The portrait was painted on the back of a canvas, as J. saw when it was
sent to the London Memorial Exhibition, as Otto Bacher saw when
the picture was in Whistler's studio in 1883:</p>

<p>"I noticed that it was painted on the back of a canvas, on the face
of which was the portrait of a child. My remark, 'Why, you have
painted your mother on the back of a canvas!' received simply the
reply: 'Isn't that a good surface?'"</p>

<p>There was scarcely any paint used, Greaves says, the canvas being
simply rubbed over to get the dress, and, as at first the dado had been
painted across the canvas, it shows through the skirt. Harper Pennington
says that the canvas, being absorbent, was stained all through from
the painting on the face. But this does not alter Greaves' statement.
That wonderful handkerchief in the tired old hands, Greaves describes
as "nothing but a bit of white and oil."</p>

<p>What Whistler wanted was to place upon canvas a beautiful arrangement,
a beautiful pattern, of colour and line. No painter since Hals
and Velasquez thought so much of placing his figure on the canvas
inside the frame. No painter since Velasquez understood so well the
value of restrained line and restrained colour. The long, vertical
and horizontal lines in the background, the footstool, the matting,
the brushwork on the wall, add quietness to the portrait, tranquillity
to the pose that could be kept for ever; a contrast to the frenzied
squirms preferred by his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.
Hamerton thought he must have found this pose, or the hint for it, in
the Agrippina at the Capitol in Rome, or in Canova's statue of Napoleon's
mother at Chatsworth. If Whistler found it anywhere, except
in his own studio, it could only have been at Haarlem, where Franz
Hals' old ladies sit together with the same serenity and are painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in much the same scheme. Whistler had been to Holland and seen
the beautiful group, and he was haunted by it.</p>

<p>Whistler wrote to Fantin that if the <i>Mother</i> marked any progress,
it was in the science of colour. What he wanted people to see in it,
he explained in <i>The Red Rag</i>:</p>

<p>"Take the picture of my mother, exhibited at the Royal Academy
as an <i>Arrangement in Grey and Black</i>. Now that is what it is. To me
it is interesting as a picture of my mother; but what can or ought
the public to care about the identity of the portrait?"</p>

<p>And yet Swinburne was not alone in realising its "intense pathos of
significance and tender depth of expression," while to a few Whistler
gave a glimpse of the other side, as to Mr. Harper Pennington:</p>

<p>"Did I ever tell you of an occasion when Whistler let me see him
with the paint off&mdash;with his brave mask down? Once standing by me
in his studio&mdash;Tite Street&mdash;we were looking at the <i>Mother</i>. I said some
string of words about the beauty of the face and figure, and for some
moments Jimmy looked and looked, but he said nothing. His hand
was playing with that tuft upon his nether lip. It was, perhaps, two
minutes before he spoke. 'Yes,' very slowly, and very softly&mdash;'Yes,
one does like to make one's mummy just as nice as possible!'"</p>

<p>Whistler told us that Madame Venturi, a friend of Carlyle's, determined
that he too should be painted.</p>

<p>"I used to go often to Madame Venturi's&mdash;I met Mazzini there, and
Mazzini was most charming&mdash;and Madame Venturi often visited me,
and one day she brought Carlyle. The <i>Mother</i> was there, and Carlyle
saw it, and seemed to feel in it a certain fitness of things, as Madame
Venturi meant he should&mdash;he liked the simplicity of it, the old lady
sitting with her hands in her lap&mdash;and he said he would be painted. And
he came one morning soon, and he sat down, and I had the canvas
ready and the brushes and palette, and Carlyle said: 'And now, mon,
fire away!' That wasn't my idea how work should be done. Carlyle
realised it, for he added: 'If ye're fighting battles or painting pictures,
the only thing to do is to fire away!' One day he told me of others
who had painted his portrait. 'There was Mr. Watts, a mon of note.
And I went to his studio, and there was much meestification, and
screens were drawn round the easel, and curtains were drawn, and I
was not allowed to see anything. And then, at last, the screens were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
put aside and there I was. And I looked. And Mr. Watts, a great
mon, he said to me, "How do you like it?" And then I turned to
Mr. Watts, and I said, "Mon, I would have ye know I am in the hobit
of wurin' clean lunen!"'"</p>

<p>Carlyle told people that he sat there talking and talking, and that
Whistler went on working and working and paid no attention to him
whatever. Whistler found Carlyle a delightful person, and Carlyle
found him a workman. And it has been said that they used to take
walks together, but of this we have no record.</p>

<p>Before the portrait was finished, Whistler had begun to paint Miss
Alexander, and another story is of a meeting at the door between the
old man coming out and the little girl going in. "Who is that?"
he asked the maid. "Miss Alexander, who is sitting to Mr. Whistler."
Carlyle shook his head. "Puir lassie! Puir lassie!" Mrs. Leyland,
at whose portrait also Whistler was working, remembered that Carlyle
grumbled a good deal. Whistler, in the end, had, it is said, to get
Phil Morris to sit for the coat. Walter Greaves' memories are of
impatience in the studio, especially when Carlyle saw Whistler working
with small brushes, so that Whistler either worked with big brushes or
pretended to. William Allingham wrote of the sittings in his diary:</p>

<p>"Carlyle tells me he is sitting to Whistler. If C. makes signs of
changing his position, W. screams out in an agonised tone: 'For God's
sake, don't move!' C. afterwards said that all W.'s anxiety seemed to
be to get the coat painted to ideal perfection; the face went for little.
He had begun by asking two or three sittings, but managed to get a
great many. At last C. flatly rebelled. He used to define W. as the
most absurd creature on the face of the earth."</p>

<p>Around this portrait many legends are gathering. Mr. F. Ernest
Jackson has told us that a few years ago, one evening in Hyde Park,
he was seated on a bench sketching, and an old man came up to him
and, seeing he was an artist, asked if he knew Whistler. Then
the old man said that his father had posed for the picture. Whether
this was Carlyle revisiting the haunts of his walks or a pure invention
we do not know. Another tale is that Whistler never painted the picture,
which is the work of an anonymous Academician, done as a bet
that he could do a Whistler&mdash;it is a pity the Academician never did any
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>If Carlyle liked the portrait of the <i>Mother</i>, he must have liked his
own. There is the same quiet balance, the same careful spacing.
Take away either the circular print or the Butterfly in its circle, and
the repose is gone. But with such care has every detail been arranged,
one never thinks of the balance, the arabesque, the pattern. It is
done, and all traces of the thought and the work are gone. One sees
only the result Whistler meant should be seen. It has been criticised
for showing a want of invention. But if the background and the
arrangement are somewhat the same as in the <i>Mother</i>, it was because he
was deliberately carrying out the same scheme. It was his <i>Arrangement
in Grey and Black, No. II</i>. In the London Memorial Exhibition it
hung opposite the <i>Mother</i>, and as they were seen together, the pose
and colour and design belonged as inevitably to the nervous old man
as to the old lady in her beautiful tranquillity. Whistler is also
said to have made a study of Carlyle's head, owned by Mr. Burton
Mansfield, and there is a small study of the pose on the back of a
canvas, once owned by Greaves.</p>

<p>The <i>Harmony in Grey and Green; Portrait of Miss Alexander</i>,
a commission from Mr. W. C. Alexander, was painted at the
same time, and proves how little Whistler's invention was at fault.
There was no repetition. The little girl, in her white and green
frock, holding at her side her grey feathered hat, butterflies hovering
about her, the weariness of the pose expressed in the pouting red lips,
as she stands by the grey wall with its long lines of black, is as familiar
as Velasquez' Infantas. Less known is Whistler's care in every detail
to make it a masterpiece. He, or his mother, gave Mrs. Alexander
directions as to the quality of the muslin for the gown, where it was to
be bought, the width of the frills, the ruffles at the neck, the ribbon
bows, the way the gown was to be laundried. And only after repeatedly
seeing and studying the picture, does one learn his care in weaving the
colour through the design. He called the portrait <i>Harmony in Grey
and Green</i>, but the colours which bind the arrangement together,
which play all through it, are green and gold. So wonderfully are
these colours used like threads in tapestry that one does not see
them, one feels the result. As always, there was the great simple
design; the pose of Velasquez, the decoration of Japan, worked out
in his own way. The gold runs along the top of the dado; tiny gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
buckles fasten the rosettes of the shoes; there is a gold pin in the
hair; the gold of the daisies is repeated in the butterflies which
flutter above the head; a note of gold is in the pile of drapery, and
the floor has a suggestion of gold in the matting. Green plays the
same note. The green sash is carried down by the green feather
of the hat, lost in the shadow, which is filled with green and gold.
And the green of the daisies is repeated in the green of the drapery.
It is not until one has gone all over the picture that these things
become evident. The shoes look perfectly black, and so does the
dado, and yet there is no pure black anywhere. The whole is bound
together by this grey, green, black, and gold scheme running through
the composition. It is a perfect harmony. And so subtle is
it, that only the result is evident, never the means by which it was
obtained.</p>

<p>The story of the sittings we have from Miss Cicely Alexander
(Mrs. Spring-Rice):</p>

<p>"My father wanted him to paint us all, I believe, beginning with
the eldest (my sister, whom he afterwards began to paint, but whose
portrait was never finished). But after coming down to see us, he wrote
and said he would like to begin with 'the light arrangement,' meaning
me, as my sister was dark. So I was the first victim, and I'm afraid
I rather considered that I was a victim all through the sittings, or
rather standings, for he never let me change my position, and I believe
I sometimes used to stand for hours at a time. I know I used to get
very tired and cross, and often finished the days in tears. This was
especially when he had promised to release me at a given time to go
to a dancing-class, but when the time came I was still standing, and the
minutes slipped away, and he was quite absorbed and had quite forgotten
all about his promise, and never noticed the tears; he used to
stand a good way from his canvas, and then dart at it and then dart
back, and he often turned round to look in a looking-glass that hung
over the mantelpiece at his back&mdash;I suppose, to see the reflection of his
painting. Although he was rather inhuman about letting me stand
on for hours and hours, as it seemed to me at the time, he was most kind
in other ways. If a blessed black fog came up from the river, and I
was allowed to get down, he never made any objection to my poking
about among his paints, and I even put charcoal eyes to some of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sketches of portraits done in coloured chalks on brown paper, and he
also constantly promised to paint my doll, but this promise was never
kept. I was painted at the little house in Chelsea, and at the time he
was decorating the staircase; it was to have a dado of gold, and it was
all done in gold-leaf, and laid on by himself, I believe; he had numberless
little books of gold-leaf lying about, and any that weren't exactly
of the old-gold shade he wanted, he gave to me.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Whistler was living then, and used to preside at delightful
American luncheons, but I don't remember that she ever came into
the studio&mdash;a servant used to be sent to tell him lunch was ready, and
then he went on again as before. He painted, and despair filled my soul,
and I believe it was generally teatime before we went to those lunches,
at which we had hot biscuits and tinned peaches, and other unwholesome
things, and I believe the biscuits came out of a little oven in the
chimney, though I can't quite think how that could have been. The
studio was at the back of the house, and the drawing-room looked over
the river, and we seldom went into it, but I remember that he had matting
on the floor, and a large Japanese basin with water and goldfish in
it. I never met Mr. Carlyle in the studio, although he was being painted
at the same time, but he shook hands with me at the private view at
the Grosvenor Gallery, where the two portraits were exhibited for
the first time. [This must have been at Whistler's own exhibition
in 1874.] I didn't appreciate that honour at the time, any more than
I appreciated being painted by Mr. Whistler, and I'm afraid all my
memories only show that I was a very grumbling disagreeable little
girl. Of course, I was too young to appreciate Mr. Whistler himself,
though afterwards we were very good friends when I grew older, and
when he used to come to my father's house and make at once for the
portrait with his eye-glass up."</p>

<p>It is said that tears were not only the little girl's, but Whistler's,
and that there were seventy sittings before he finished. Mrs. Spring-Rice
writes nothing about the number of times the picture was rubbed
out and recommenced. He was beginning to put in the entire scheme
at once, but on such large canvases this was difficult. Walter Greaves
says that the picture was painted on an absorbent canvas, and on a
distemper ground. There is also a study for the head.</p>

<p>Whistler was as minute in his directions for the portrait of Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
May Alexander. He recommended to Mrs. Alexander a milliner
who sold wonderful "picture hats"; he suggested that he should
paint the portrait in the house at Campden Hill, so that he could see
the effect of the picture in the drawing-room where it was to hang.
But it remains a sketch of a girl in riding-habit, drawing on her gloves,
at her side a pot of flowers, the one detail carried out. He made a
number of other sketches in oils, chalk, pen and ink, of the children,
and there is a study for Miss May's head also. But only the <i>Arrangement
in Grey and Green</i> was finished.</p>

<p>Frederick Leyland, the wealthy shipowner, who had met Whistler
as early as 1867, about this time commissioned Whistler to paint his
four children, Mrs. Leyland, and himself. Leyland had not yet bought
his London house, but often came up to town, and Whistler made
long visits at Speke Hall, Leyland's place near Liverpool. Mrs.
Whistler spent months there. The record of his visits is in the etchings
and dry-points of <i>Speke Hall</i> and <i>Speke Shore</i>, <i>Shipping at Liverpool</i>,
<i>The Dam Wood</i>, and the portraits in many mediums. Speke Hall,
Whistler said, put him in better mood for work. The house was not
far from the sea, where he found much to do. But the beach was
flat, at low tide the sea ran away from him, and at high tide the skies
were wrong or the wind blew, and when the sea failed he turned to
the portraits. The big canvases travelled with him, backward and
forward, from Speke Hall to London, and the sittings were continued
in both places. They all sat to him. The children hated
posing as much as they delighted in the painter. The son, after three
sittings, refused to sit again, which is to be regretted, for the pastel
of him, lounging in a chair, with big hat pushed back and long legs
stretched out, is full of boyhood. There are pastels of the three little
girls, sketches in pen and ink and pencil, one among the few studies for
etchings, and the dry-points. Of Florence Leyland, a large, full-length
oil was started, the first of his <i>Blue Girls</i> in which he wished to
paint blue on blue as he had painted white on white. Another portrait
of her was never finished and, we believe, never exhibited until it was
purchased, in 1906, for the Brooklyn Museum. The full-length of
Leyland was the only one completed. Of this there is a small oil
study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> painted Leyland standing, in evening dress, with the ruffled
shirt he always wore, against a dark background, the first arrangement
of black on black. Leyland was good about standing, we know from
Mrs. Leyland, but he had not much time, and few portraits gave
Whistler more trouble. Leyland told Val Prinsep that Whistler nearly
cried over the drawing of the legs. Greaves says that "he got into an
awful mess over it," painted it out again and again, and finally had in a
model to pose for it nude. It was finished in the winter of 1873. In the
portrait of Leyland he began to suppress the background, to put the
figures into the atmosphere in which they stood, without accessories.
The problem was the atmospheric envelope, to make the figures stand
in this atmosphere, as far within their frames as he stood from them
when he painted, a problem at which he worked as long as he lived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leyland had more leisure than her husband, and the sittings
amused her. She had sat to Rossetti, she was to sit to others. She
was beautiful, with wonderful red hair. Whistler made a dry-point
of her, <i>The Velvet Gown</i>, and in black velvet she wanted to be painted.
But he preferred a dress in harmony with her hair, and designed rose
draperies falling in sweeping curves, and he placed her against a rose-flushed
wall with a spray of rose almond blossoms at her side. In no
other portrait did he attempt a scheme of colour at once so sumptuous
and so delicate. The pose was natural to her, she said, though he made
a number of pastel schemes before he painted it. Her back is turned,
her arms fall loosely, her hands clasped behind her, her head in profile.
Mrs. Leyland remembered days when, at the end of the pose, the
portrait looked as if it needed only a few hours' work. But in the
morning she would find it rubbed out and all the work to be done again.
Notwithstanding the innumerable sittings, one of Whistler's models,
Maud Franklin, whom he so often etched and painted, was called in
to pose for the gown. Whistler knew what he wanted, and nothing
else would satisfy him. It must be beautiful to be worthy of the
weariness it caused her, he told Mrs. Leyland, and he was trying for
the little more that meant perfection. The portrait was never finished,
and yet it could not be lovelier. It was a problem, not of luminous
dark, but of luminous light, and the accessories have not been suppressed.
The matting on the floor, the dado, and the spray of almond blossoms
are more elaborately carried out than the detail of any other portrait.
What worried him, and probably prevented the picture being finished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
were the hands, almost untouched. It was not that he could not draw
hands, for they are beautifully drawn sometimes, notably in the etchings.
But he rarely painted them well. He nearly always left them to
the last, and some of his later pictures were unfinished because he could
not get the hands right. In the <i>Sarasate</i>, <i>The Little White Girl</i>, the
<i>Symphony in White, No. III.</i>, the hands are beautifully painted. Some
one has said that an artist is known by his painting of hands. These
three pictures prove that Whistler could paint hands, but it is as true
that he did not paint them when he could help it.</p>

<p>The portrait of Mrs. Louis Huth was not only begun but finished
during these years. It is Holbein-like in its dignity, its sobriety, the
flat modelling, the exquisite rendering of the lace at the throat and the
wrists. Mrs. Huth wears the black velvet Mrs. Leyland wanted to
wear, and the background is black of wonderful, luminous, intense
depth. She, too, stands with her back turned, and her head in profile.
In this portrait, as in the full-length Leyland, Whistler carried out his
method of putting in the whole subject at once. The background
was as much a part of the design as the figure. If anything went wrong
anywhere the whole had to come out and be started again. It was
a difficult problem, but the theory taught by Gleyre, and developed in
the Nocturnes, was perfected in the portraits of <i>Frederick Leyland</i> and
<i>Mrs. Huth</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leyland sometimes met Mrs. Huth as they came and went,
and this fixes the date of the portrait. Mrs. Huth was not strong,
and Whistler exhausted the strongest who posed for him. Almost
daily, during one summer, he kept her standing for three hours without
rest. At last she rebelled. Watts, she said, who had painted her had
not treated her in that way. "And still, you know, you come to me!"
was Whistler's comment. He had some mercy, however, and at times
a model stood for her dress.</p>

<p>After the Academy of 1874 opened with nothing of his in it, Whistler
took matters into his own hands, and, like Courbet in 1855, and Manet
in 1867, organised a show of his own&mdash;his first "one man" show. The
gallery was at No. 48 Pall Mall, and the collection included these large
portraits, a few Nocturnes, one or two earlier paintings, and one or
two of the <i>Projects</i>. Thirteen in all. There were fifty etchings.
The walls were grey, the exhibits were well spaced, there were palms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and flowers, blue pots and bronzes. He designed the card of invitation,
the simple card he always used, and his mother and Greaves wrote the
names and addresses, "all making Butterflies as hard as we could,"
Walter Greaves says, rushing out and posting the cards until the letter-boxes
of Chelsea were in a state of congestion. The private view was
on June 6. The catalogue is vague.</p>

<p>The exhibition was a shock to London. The decorations seemed an
indiscretion, for no one before had suggested to people, whose standard
was the Academy, that a show of pictures might be beautiful. The
work scandalised a generation blinded by the yearly Academic bazaar;
they could not see the beauty of flat modelling and flesh low in tone,
they preferred the "foolish sunset" to the poetry of night. But
the pictures could have been forgiven more easily than the titles.
From the moment he exhibited them as <i>Arrangements</i> and <i>Nocturnes</i>,
his reputation for eccentricity was established. He wrote in <i>The
Gentle Art</i>:</p>

<p>"I know that many good people think my nomenclature funny and
myself 'eccentric'. Yes, 'eccentric' is the adjective they find for me.
The vast majority of English folk cannot and will not consider a picture
as a picture, apart from any story which it may be supposed to tell....
As music is the poetry of sound, so is painting the poetry of sight, and the
subject-matter has nothing to do with harmony of sound or of colour."</p>

<p>Well received at first, his position in public favour had of late
hung in the balance. The exhibition weighed in the scales against him,
and for almost twenty years to come, ridicule was his portion. The
<i>Athenæum</i> and the <i>Saturday Review</i> ignored the show. The <i>Pall Mall</i>
saw in it more intellect than imagination. Here and there was a polite
murmur of "noble conception" and "Velasquez touch." Of all that
was said Whistler singled out for notice then, and preservation afterwards,
the comments of a forgotten journal, the <i>Hour</i>. It has been
wondered why he noticed papers of small importance. When he
answered the critics and kept the correspondence, it was "to make
history," he said, and he selected what he thought important, though
it might come from an unimportant source. The <i>Hour</i> suggested
that the best work was not of recent date; Whistler wrote to remove
"the melancholy impression"; and notice and letter "make history,"
for it was about this time that English critics, following the lead of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
French, were beginning to say that he did not fulfil his early promise,
and it is recorded in <i>The Gentle Art</i>.</p>

<p>The pictures of this period that remain may seem few in number.
But others were completed or in progress, and disappeared before they
were exhibited or seen outside the studio. We have reason to believe,
however, that some have been recently discovered and eventually will
not be lost to the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV: THE OPEN DOOR.<br />THE YEAR EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-FOUR AND AFTER.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">"Whistler</span> laughed all his troubles away," it has been said. When
the Academy rejected him, and the critics sneered at his pictures
hung in other galleries, and the public took the critics seriously, he
laughed the louder, and felt the more. English ears shrank from
his laugh&mdash;"his strident peacock laugh," Sir Sidney Colvin called it.</p>

<p>"He was a man who could never bear to be alone," Mr.
Percy Thomas remembers. "The door in Lindsey Row was always
open," and Whistler liked to think that his friends' doors were
open to him. Lord Redesdale, who came to live in the Row in 1875,
said that Whistler was always running in and out. Through his
own open door strange people drifted. If they amused him he forgave
them however they presumed, and they usually did presume. There
was a man who, he told us, came to dine one evening, and, asking to
stay overnight, remained three years:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, there he was; and that was the way he had
always lived&mdash;the prince of parasites! He was a genius, a musician,
the first of the 'Æsthetes,' before the silly name was invented. He
hadn't anything to do; he didn't do anything but decorate the dinner-table,
arrange the flowers, and then play the piano and talk. He
hadn't any enthusiasm; that's why he was so restful. He was always
ready to go to Cremorne with me. At moments my mother objected
to such a loafer about the house. And I would say to her, 'Well,
but, my dear mummy, who else is there to whom we could say, "Play,"
and he would play, and "Stop playing," and he would stop right
away!' Then I was ill. He couldn't be trusted with a message
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to the doctor or the druggist, and he was only in the way. But he
had the good sense to see it, and to suggest it was time to be going;
so he left for somebody else! It never occurred to him there was any
reason he shouldn't live like that."</p>

<p>We have heard of many others. One, to whom Whistler entrusted
the money for the weekly bills, gave lunches to his friends and sent
flowers and chocolates right and left, while Whistler's debt multiplied.</p>

<p>Artists and art students came in through the open door to see
and to learn, and were welcomed. If they came to loaf and to play,
they paid for it. They ran errands, posted letters, sat in the corner,
interviewed greater bores than themselves. They had to give up
their time, and then the end came, and out they went.</p>

<p>One story in Chelsea is of Barthe, who not only taught art but
sold tapestry. Whistler bought a number of things from him. "But
vill he pay, zis Vistlaire, vill he pay?" Barthe asked, and at last one
evening he went to Lindsey Row. A cab was at the door. The maid
said Whistler was not in, but Barthe heard his voice and pushed past,
and said afterwards:</p>

<p>"Upstairs, I find him, before a little picture painting, and behind
him ze bruzzers Greaves holding candle. And Vistlaire he say, 'You
ze very man I vant; hold a candle!' And I hold a candle. And
Vistlaire he paint, and he paint, and zen he take ze picture, and he
go downstair, and he get in ze cab, and he drive off, and we hold ze
candle, and I see him no more. <i>Mon Dieu, il est terrible, ce Vistlaire!</i>"
But he was paid the next day.</p>

<p>Few men depended more on companionship than Whistler, and
to few was the companionship women alone can give more essential.
All his life he retained his <i>c&oelig;ur de femme</i>, and most of his friends were
women. For years, until her health broke down, his mother was with
him. Many wondered, with Val Prinsep, who thought Whistler "always
acting a part," whether "behind the <i>poseur</i>, there was not quite a
different Whistler. Those who saw him with his mother were conscious
of the fact that the irrepressible Jimmy was very human. No
one could have been a better son, or more attentive to his mother's
wishes. Sometimes old Mrs. Whistler, who was a stern Presbyterian
in her religion, must have been very trying to her son. Yet Jimmy,
though he used to give a queer smile when he mentioned them, never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in any way complained of the old lady's strict Sabbatarian notions,
to which he bowed without remonstrance."</p>

<p>The models drifting in and out of the open door were mostly
women. He liked to have them with him, and felt it necessary to
see them about the studio, for, as he watched their movements, they
would take the pose he wanted, or suggest a group, an arrangement.
An admirable example is the <i>Whistler in his Studio</i>, done in the first
house in Lindsey Row. It was a beautiful study, he wrote to Fantin,
for a big picture like the <i>Hommage à Delacroix</i>, with Fantin, Albert
Moore, and himself, the "White Girl" on a couch, and <i>la Japonaise</i>
walking about, grouped together in his studio: all that would shock
the Academicians. The colour was to be dainty; he in pale grey,
Jo in white, <i>la Japonaise</i> in flesh-colour, Albert Moore and Fantin
to give the black note. The canvas was to be ten feet by six. If he
ever did more than the study of the two girls and himself, it has
disappeared. The painting was owned by Mr. Douglas Freshfield,
and now belongs to the Chicago Art Institute, and is as dainty as
Whistler described it. He holds the small palette he sometimes used
with raised edges to keep the liquid colour from running off, he wears
the long-sleeved white waistcoat in which he worked, and he painted
from the reflection in the mirror, for his brush is in his left hand.
The two women most likely are the two models for <i>Symphony in
White, No. III.</i>, who have stopped posing. Another version of this
studio interior is in the City of Dublin Art Gallery, but Whistler repudiated
it. Mr. Gallatin says that Sir Hugh Lane, who presented the
picture to the Dublin Gallery, gave it a very different record, holding
that it was well known in Chelsea, that Whistler liked it, and eventually
painted for Mr. Freshfield the version now in the Chicago Art Institute.
The truth of the matter, however, is that not only did Whistler repudiate
the Dublin picture, but, when it was shown as the original in the
Whistler Memorial Exhibition in London, Mr. Freshfield demanded
that this description be at once withdrawn or he would remove the
picture and sue the International Society, who organised the Exhibition,
for false statements and damages. Sir Hugh Lane did not produce
during his lifetime one scrap of proof in corroboration of statements
denied by Whistler, nor has any proof been produced since his death.
Another reason to doubt Lane's description is that Whistler never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
copied one of his pictures, and the Dublin Gallery's version is a slavish
copy, save in the colour scheme. Whistler never painted it. There is
nothing else of the kind so complete as <i>Whistler in his Studio</i>, but there
are innumerable studies of figures, reading or sewing, not posing,
though the minute he started to draw them they had to pose. Everybody
who was with him, and somebody always was, had to sit and be
painted, etched, or drawn.</p>

<p>Refugees from France in 1870 drifted through the open door,
artists whose work was stopped by the Commune and who came to
England to take it up again. There were Dalou, Professor Lantéri,
and Tissot who, at Lindsey Row, found the inspiration for his pictures
on the river. Fantin stayed in Paris, but later told stories of the siege
which Whistler repeated to us. He asked Fantin what he did. "Me?"
replied Fantin, "I hid in the cellar. <i>Je suis poltron, moi.</i>" One of
Fantin's many letters to Edwin Edwards shows Whistler's hold over
those who were drawn to him for a better reason than curiosity. It
was long since Fantin had heard from Whistler, for whom, however,
he wrote, his affection was that of a man for a mistress still loved despite
the trouble she might give. He did not understand women, they
frightened him, "<i>mais au fond, tout au fond, je sens que si j'étais aimé,
je serais l'esclave le plus soumis et serais peut-être capable de toutes les
plus grandes folies. Je sens que c'est la même chose pour Whistler: s'il
savait comme il pourrait avoir un ami dévoué et aimant en moi. Malgré
tout, il est séduisant.</i>"</p>

<p>And yet they saw less of each other as the years went on, perhaps
because Fantin became more of a hermit, while Whistler's door opened
wider.</p>

<p>Journalists and critics hurried to Lindsey Row once they knew the
door was open. Mr. Walter Greaves, who sometimes showed the
studio, remembers doing the honours for Tom Taylor. Whistler
told Mr. Sidney Starr that, while the <i>Miss Alexander</i> was in the studio,
Tom Taylor came:</p>

<p>"There were other visitors. Taylor said, 'Ah, yes, um,' then
remarked that the upright line in the panelling of the wall was wrong,
and the picture would be better without it, adding, 'Of course, it's
a matter of taste.' To which Whistler replied, 'I thought that perhaps
for once you were going to get away without having said anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
foolish; but remember, so that you may not make the mistake again,
it's not a matter of taste at all, it is a matter of knowledge. Good-bye.'"</p>

<p>Journalists and critics filled columns with praise of forgotten masterpieces
by unknown Academicians, but seldom spared space for the
work in Whistler's studio. Their gossip after the visit was about the
man, not his pictures.</p>

<p>Poets, the younger literary men, came in through the open door.
Mr. Edmund Gosse, introduced by Mr. W. M. Rossetti, has described
to us his impressions of the bare room with little in it but the easel,
and of the small, alert, nervous man with keen eyes and beautiful
hands who sat before it, looking at his canvas, never moving but looking
steadily for twenty minutes or half an hour, perhaps, and then, of a
sudden, dashing at it, giving it one touch, and saying, "There, well,
I think that will do for to-day!" an astonishing experience to one used
to tapestried studios and painters more industrious with their hands
than their brains.</p>

<p>The fashionable world, royalty, crowded through the open door.
Lindsey Row was lined with the carriages of Mayfair and Belgravia.
Whistler was the fashion, if his pictures were not, and he could say
nothing, he could do nothing, that did not go the rounds of drawing-rooms
and dinner-tables. "Ha, ha! I have no private life!" he
told a man who threatened him with exposure. And, from this time
onward, he never had.</p>

<p>He knew what his popularity meant. It was among the numbers
who gathered about him because he was the fashion, that he could not
afford to have friends.</p>

<p>If the frequent use of the name "Jimmie" by people in speaking
and writing of him implies a friendliness on his part with every
Tom, Dick, and Harry, nothing could be further from the fact.
His friends, who were his contemporaries, called him "Jimmie," but
rarely to his face, and the rest who did once had not the courage to
a second time. We remember a foolish youth who, meeting him
at our table, addressed him in free and easy fashion as "Whistler."
He said nothing. He only looked, but the youth did not forget the
Mr. after that. Whistler was the last man to allow familiarity or
to make friends. He understood how to keep at a distance those he
did not know or did not want to know.</p>

<p>It was thought that he could not live without fighting, that to
him "battle was the spice of life." But he never fought until fighting
was forced upon him. There were no fights, just as there was no
mystery, at first. Every man was a friend until he proved himself
an enemy. Whistler's temper was violent. Few who ever saw him
roused can forget the fire of his eyes, the fury of his face, the sting
of his tongue. He was terrible then, and lost all control of himself.
But there was always good cause for his rage, and once the storm had
passed he laughed this, as all his other troubles, away and when the
fighting began enjoyed it. He liked a fight, roared over it. Lord
Redesdale told us Whistler would come to him in the morning at
breakfast, or in the evening after dinner, to read the latest correspondence,
discovering the dullness of the enemy.</p>

<p>Whistler delighted in society, finding in it the change most men
find in sport or travel. He hated anything that stopped his work.
Hunting and fishing were an abomination. We never heard of his
attempting to shoot, except once at the Leylands', when, he said:
"I rather fancied I shot part of a hare, for I thought I saw the fluff
of its fur flying. I knew I hit a dog, for I saw the keeper taking out
the shot!" His solicitor, Mr. William Webb, tried once to teach him
to ride a bicycle. "Learn it? No," he said to us. "Why, I fell
right off&mdash;but I fell in a rose-bush!" Motoring offended him and
he abused J. for taking it up. But people amused him, and he enjoyed
the "parade of life." This is the explanation of the dandyism that
has shocked more than one of his critics. Whistler was never content
with half-measures. He would not have played the social game at
all had he not been able to play it well, and if taking infinite pains with
his appearance means dandyism, then he was a dandy. The very word
pleased him, and he used it often, in American fashion, to express
perfection or charm or beauty. Never was any man more particular
about his person and his dress. He was as careful of his hair as a woman,
though there was no need of the curling-tongs with which he has been
reproached; the difficulty was to restrain his curls and keep them in
order. The white lock gave just the right touch. However fashion
changed, he always wore the moustache and little imperial which
other West Point men of his generation retained through life. Even
his thick bushy eyebrows were trained, and they added to the humorous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
or sardonic expression of the deep blue eyes from which many shrank.
His beautiful hands and nails were beautifully kept. In his dress
was always something a little different from that of other men. His
clothes were speckless, faultless, fitting irreproachably. He preferred
pumps to boots, short sack-coats to tailed coats. His linen was of the
finest, and a little Butterfly was embroidered on his handkerchief;
and his near-sightedness was a reason for the monocle of which he
knew how to make such good use. He was long at his toilet, minute
in every detail. Before entering a drawing-room we have seen him
pause to adjust his curls and his cravat. So it was with everything.
There was dandyism in his delicate handwriting, and the same care
went to the arrangement of his cards of invitation and his letters;
he would consider even the placing of his signature on a receipt. And
he devoted no less attention to his breakfasts and dinners that made
the talk of the town. He respected the art of cookery&mdash;the "Family
Bible" he called the cook-book; he ate little, but that little had to
be perfect both in cooking and serving.</p>

<p>From the beginning at Lindsey Row he gave these breakfasts
and dinners. Mr. Luke Ionides remembers calling one afternoon when
"Jimmy was busy putting things straight; he asked me if I had any
money. I told him I had twelve shillings. He said that was enough.
We went out together, and he bought three chairs at two-and-sixpence
each, and three bottles of claret at eighteenpence each, and three sticks
of sealing-wax of different colours at twopence each. On our return
he sealed the top of each bottle with a different coloured wax. He
then told me he expected a possible buyer to dinner, and two other
friends. When we had taken our seats at the table, he very solemnly
told the maid to go down and bring up a bottle of wine, one of those
with the red seal. The maid could hardly suppress a grin, but I alone
saw it. Then, after the meat, he told her to fetch a bottle with the
blue seal; and with dessert the one with the yellow seal was brought,
and all were drunk in perfect innocence and delight. He sold his
picture, and said he was sure the sealing-wax had done it."</p>

<p>All his life he invented wines and was continually making "finds."
We remember his discovery of a wonderful Croûte Mallard at the
Café Royal, and an equally wonderful Pouilly supplied by his French
barber, who had been one of Napoleon III.'s generals or Maximilian's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<i>aides-de-camp</i>. Another thing at the Café Royal besides the <i>menu</i>
was the N on the wine-glasses, which were said to have come from
the Tuileries in 1870, but, no matter how many have been broken,
it is still there. Though he liked good wine, he drank as little as he
ate. One of the innumerable stories often repeated may give a different
idea. After a dinner in somebody's new house he slipped on the stairs
and fell. As he was helped up, he was asked if he had hurt himself.
"No," he said, "but it's all the fault of the damned teetotal architect."
Those who dined with him, or with whom he dined, knew that he
was one of the most abstemious of men. On the other hand, it was
astonishing how quickly some things went to his head. In later days
when J. would stop with him at Frascati's, on the way home from the
studio, the talk grew gayer, the "Ha! Ha!" louder with the first
sip of his absinthe.</p>

<p>We have the story of his first dinner-party from Mr. Walter Greaves,
whose workman was sent to Madame Venturi's to borrow, and came
back hung about with, pots and kettles and pans, and from Mrs. Leyland,
who lent her butler and at the last moment, with her sister, put up
muslin curtains at the windows. Guests remember Whistler's alarm
when a near-sighted young lady in white mistook the Japanese bath,
filled with water-lilies, for a divan, and tried to sit on the goldfish;
and Leyland's disgust when Grisi's daughter, whom he took in to
dinner, would talk to him not of music, but of Ouida's novels. Everyone
found the <i>menu</i> "a little eccentric, but excellent." The earliest <i>menu</i>
we have seen is one, in Mr. Walter Dowdeswell's possession, of a dinner
in the eighties, as simple as it is characteristic of Whistler, and we give
it: <i>Potage Potiron</i>; <i>Soles Frites</i>; <i>B&oelig;uf à la Mode</i>; <i>Chapon au Cresson</i>;
<i>Salade Laitue</i>; <i>Marmalade de Pommes</i>; <i>Omelette au Fromage</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Alan S. Cole's diary is the record of dinners in the seventies,
of the company, and the talk:</p>

<p>"<i>November 16</i> (1875). Dined with Jimmy; Tissot, A. Moore,
and Captain Crabb. Lovely blue and white china, and capital small
dinner. General conversation and ideas on art unfettered by principles.
Lovely Japanese lacquer.</p>

<p>"<i>December 7</i> (1875). Dined with Jimmy; Cyril Flower, Tissot,
Story. Talked Balzac&mdash;<i>Père Goriot&mdash;Cousine Bette&mdash;Cousin Pons&mdash;Jeune
Homme de Province à Paris&mdash;Illusions perdues</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>January 6</i> (1876). With my father and mother to dine at
Whistler's. Mrs. Montiori, Mrs. Stansfield, and Gee there. My
father on the innate desire or ambition of some men to be creators,
either physical or mental. Whistler considered art had reached a
climax with Japanese and Velasquez. He had to admit natural instinct
and influence, and the ceaseless changing in all things.</p>

<p>"<i>March 12</i> (1876). Dined with Jimmy. Miss Franklin there.
Great conversation of Spiritualism, in which J. believes. We tried
to get raps, but were unsuccessful, except in getting noises from sticky
fingers on the table.</p>

<p>"<i>March 25</i> (1876). Round to Whistler's to dine. Mrs. Leyland
and Mrs. Galsworthy and others.</p>

<p>"<i>September 16</i> (1876). Dined with W. Eldon there. Hot discussion
about Napoleon (<i>Napoléon le petit</i>, by Hugo). The Commune, with
which J. sympathised [some fellow-feeling for Courbet, the reason
perhaps]. Spiritualism.</p>

<p>"<i>December 29</i> (1876). To dine with J.&mdash;the Doctor. Goldfish
in bowl. Japanese trays&mdash;storks and birds. He read out two or three
stories by Bret Harte: <i>Luck of Roaring Camp</i>, <i>The Outcasts of Poker
Flat</i>, <i>Tennessee's Partner</i>. Chatted as to doing illustration for a catalogue
for Mitford, and as to his Japanese woman, and a decorated room
for the Museum.</p>

<p>"<i>February 18</i> (1878). To Whistler's. Mark Twain's haunting
jingle in the tramcar: 'Punch, brothers, punch with care; punch
in the presence of the passenjaire!'</p>

<p>"<i>March 27</i> (1878). Dined with Whistler, young Mills and Lang,
who writes. He seemed shocked by much that was said by Jimmy
and Eldon."</p>

<p>Whistler delighted not only in Mark Twain's, but in all jingles.
He had an endless stock and recited them in the most unexpected places
and at the most inappropriate moments. He went to the trouble
to write down for us the lines of the <i>Woodchuck</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i6"><i>"How much wood would the woodchuck chuck</i></div>
<div class="i6"><i>If the woodchuck could chuck wood?</i></div>
<div class="i6"><i>Why! just as much as the woodchuck would</i></div>
<div class="i6"><i>If the woodchuck could chuck wood!"</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>And as we read them in the familiar writing, we wonder why they never
seemed foolish, but quite right, as he chanted them. In the Haden
correspondence, published in <i>The Gentle Art</i>, a new version of Peter
Piper may be found. He loved to quote the <i>Danbury News</i> man
and the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. He never lost his joy in American humour,
and because there is something of the same spirit in Rossetti's limericks
he never tired of repeating them, especially the two beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i3"><i>"There is an old person named Scott</i></div>
<div class="i3"><i>Who thinks he can paint and cannot,"</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i3"><i>"There is an old painter called Sandys</i></div>
<div class="i3"><i>Who suffers from one of his glands."</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whistler invented Sunday breakfasts. The day was unusual in
London and also the hour&mdash;twelve instead of nine. "Nothing
exactly like them has ever been in the world. They were as much
himself as his work," George Boughton wrote. Whistler arranged the
table, seeing that everything placed on it was beautiful: the blue
and white, the silver, the linen, the Japanese bowl of goldfish or the
vase of flowers in the centre. If his resources failed, he borrowed
from Lord Redesdale, or, after his brother was married, from Mrs.
William Whistler, whose Japanese lacquer was his admiration. He
prepared the <i>menu</i>, partly American, partly French, and wholly
bewildering to joint-loving Britons. His description of the British
breakfasts he was asked to were amazing: "Beef, the people or the
rats had been gnawing, beer, and cheese rinds, salad without dressing
and tarts without taste. Quite British!" His buckwheat cakes are
not forgotten. He would make them himself, if the party were informal,
and he never spoke again to one man who ventured to dislike them.</p>

<p>Sometimes eighteen or twenty sat down to breakfast, more often
half that number. All were people Whistler wanted to meet, people
who talked, people who painted, people who wrote, people who bought,
people who were distinguished, people who were royal, people who
were friends. From Mr. Cole we have notes of the company and
talk at some of the breakfasts:</p>

<p>"<i>June 17</i> (1877). To breakfast at J.'s. F. Dicey, young Potter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and Huth there. He showed some studies from figures&mdash;light and
elegant&mdash;to be finished.</p>

<p>"<i>June 29</i> (1879). To Whistler's for breakfast. Much talk about
<i>Comédie-Française</i> and Sarah Bernhardt.</p>

<p>"<i>July 8</i> (1883). Breakfast at W.'s. Lord Houghton, Oscar
Wilde, Mrs. Singleton, Mrs. Moncrieff, Mrs. Gerald Potter, Lady
Archie Campbell, the Storys, Theodore Watts, and some others.
Mrs. Moncrieff sang well afterwards. Lord Houghton asked me
about my father's memoirs. Margie [Mrs. Cole] sat by him."</p>

<p>The breakfasts remain "charming" in Mrs. Moncrieff's memory.
And "charming" is Lady Colin Campbell's word. Lady Wolseley
writes us that she remembers "a flight of fans fastened up on the
walls, and also that the table had a large flat blue china bowl, or dish,
with goldfish and nasturtiums in it." Mrs. Alan S. Cole recalls a
single tall lily springing from the bowl; though invited for twelve,
it was wiser, she adds, not to arrive much before two, for to get there
earlier was often to hear Whistler splashing in his bath somewhere
close to the drawing-room. This was Mr. W. J. Rawlinson's experience
once. He had been asked for twelve, and got there a few
minutes before as for breakfast in Paris. Several guests had come,
others followed, a dozen perhaps; one was Lord Wolseley. For
Whistler they waited&mdash;and they waited and they waited. At about
half-past one they heard a splashing behind the folding-doors. There
was a moment of indignation. Then Howell hurried in, beaming
on them. "It's all right, it's all right!" he said, "Jimmie won't
be long now; he is just having his bath!" Howell talked and they
waited, and two struck before Whistler appeared, smiling, gracious,
all in white, for it was hot, and they went down to breakfast. As soon
as he came in he was so fascinating that the waiting was forgotten.
We have heard but of one person who did not like the breakfasts, an
artist who went one morning, and his story was that he drove down to
Chelsea from St. John's Wood, and found Whistler alone, and they
went into the dining-room, and there was an egg on toast for Whistler
and another egg on toast for himself, and that was all. Then Whistler
wanted to show him pictures, but he was furious, and he said, "No,
Whistler, I have paid three shillings and sixpence for a cab to come here,
and I have eaten one egg, and I will look at no pictures!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Rennell Rodd writes us of the breakfasts at 13 Tite Street,
"with the inevitable buckwheat cakes, and green corn, and brilliant
talk. One I remember particularly, for we happened to be thirteen.
There were two Miss C.'s, the younger of whom died within a week
of the breakfast; and an elderly gentleman, whose name I forget, who
was there, when he heard of it at his club, said, 'God bless my soul!'
had a stroke, and died too."</p>

<p>J. was once only at a Chelsea breakfast, in 1884, at Tite Street,
when Mr. Menpes was present. But we often breakfasted in Paris
at the Rue du Bac, and in London at the Fitzroy Street studio. It
made no difference who was there, who sat beside you, Whistler dominated
everybody and everything in his own as in every house he visited.
Though short and small&mdash;a man of diminutive stature the usual
description&mdash;his was the commanding presence. When he talked
everyone listened. At his table he had a delightful way of waiting
upon his guests. He would go round with a bottle of Burgundy
in its cradle, talking all the while, emphasising every point with a
dramatic pause just before or just after filling a glass. We remember
one Sunday in Paris in 1893&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Edwin A. Abbey and
Dr. D. S. MacColl the other guests&mdash;when he told how he hung the
pictures at the annual Liverpool exhibition in 1891:</p>

<p>"You know the Academy baby by the dozen had been sent in,
and I got them all in my gallery; and in the centre, at one end, I
placed the birth of the baby&mdash;splendid; and opposite, the baby with
the mustard-pot, and opposite that the baby with the puppy; and
in the centre, on one side, the baby ill, doctor holding its pulse, mother
weeping. On the other by the door, the baby dead, the baby's funeral,
baby from the cradle to the grave, baby in heaven, babies of all kinds
and shapes all along the line; not crowded, you know, hung with proper
respect for the baby. And on varnishing day, in came the artists,
each making for his own baby. Amazing! His baby on the line.
Nothing could be better! And they all shook my hand, and thanked
me, and went to look&mdash;at the other men's babies. And then they
saw babies in front of them, babies behind them, babies to right of
them, babies to left of them. And then, you know, their faces fell;
they didn't seem to like it&mdash;and&mdash;well&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;they never asked
me to hang the pictures again at Liverpool! What!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>As he told it he was on his feet, pouring out the Burgundy,
minutes sometimes to fill a glass. There were minutes between
one guest and the next; he seemed never to be in his chair; it was
fully two hours before the story and breakfast came to an end together.
But though no one else had a chance to talk, no one was bored. It
was the same wherever he went if the people were sympathetic. If
they were not, he could be as glum as anybody, especially if he was
expected to "show off"; or, he could go fast asleep. In sympathetic
houses he not only led the talk, he controlled it. There is a legend
that he and Mark Twain met for the first time at a dinner, when they
simultaneously asked their hostess who that noisy fellow was? For
there was noise, there was gaiety, and everybody was carried away
by it, even the servants.</p>

<p>Whistler was an artist in his use of words and phrases, making
them as much a part of his personality as the white lock and the eye-glass.
His sudden "What," his familiar "Well, you know," his
eloquent "H'm! h'm!" were placed as carefully as the Butterfly
on his card of invitation, the blue and white on his table. No man
was ever so eloquent with his hands, he could tell a whole story with
his fingers, long, thin, sensitive&mdash;"alive to the tips, like the fingers
of a mesmerist," Mr. Arthur Symons writes of them. No man ever
put so much into words as he into the pause for the laugh, into the laugh
itself, the loud, sharp "Ha, ha!" and into the deliberate adjusting
of his eye-glass. So much was in his manner that it is almost impossible
to give an idea of his talk to those who never heard it. We have listened
to him with wonder and delight, and afterwards tried to repeat what
he said, to find it fall flat and lifeless without the play of his expressive
hands, without the malice or the music of his laugh. This is why
the stories of him in print often make people marvel at the reputation
they have brought him. Not that the talk was not good; it was.
His wit was quick, spontaneous. "Providence is very good to me
sometimes," was his answer when we asked him how he found the
telling word. He has been compared to Degas, who, it is said, led
up the talk to a witticism prepared beforehand; Whistler's wit met
like a flash the challenge he could not have anticipated. He loved a
good story, made the most of it, treated it with a delicacy, a humour
that was irresistible. He could be fantastic, malicious, audacious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
serious, everything but dull or gross. He shrank from grossness. No
one, not his worst enemies, can recall a story from him with a touch
or taint of it. The ugly, the unclean revolted him.</p>

<p>We have heard of Sundays when Whistler sketched the people
who were there, hanging the sketches in his drawing-room. One Sunday
he made the dry-point of Lord (then Sir Garnet) Wolseley. Lord
Wolseley himself has forgotten it: "I fear, beyond the recollection
of an agreeable luncheon at his house at Chelsea, I have no reminiscence,"
he wrote to us. And Lady Wolseley thinks "Lord Wolseley
may have gone to him for sittings early, and have breakfasted with him.
I have a vague impression." But Howell was summoned that Sunday
from Putney to amuse the sitter and prevent his hurrying off, and he
put the date in his diary:</p>

<p>"<i>November 24</i> (1877). Went to Whistler's, met Sir Garnet
Wolseley. Whistler etched him; got two first proofs, second one
touched, 42<i>s.</i> Met Pellegrini and Godwin."</p>

<p>Whistler went everywhere, and knew everybody, though he did
not allow everybody to know him. When somebody said to him,
"The Prince of Wales says he knows you," Whistler's answer was,
"That's only his side." He lived at a rate that would have killed
most men, and at an expense in details that was fabulous. "I never
dined alone for years," he said. If no one was coming to him, if no
one had invited him, he dined at a club. He was a familiar figure,
at different periods, in the Arts, Chelsea, and Hogarth Clubs, the
Arundel, the Beaufort Grill Club, or, for supper, at the Beefsteak
Club. Many of his letters, for a period, were dated from "The
Fielding." He was once put up at the Savile, he told us, but heard no
more about it; and at the Savage, but that, he said, "is a club to belong
to, never to go to." At the Reform, had he thought of it, he lost all
chance of election one night when his laugh woke up the old gentleman
whose snores were equally loud in the reading-room. An amusing proof
of the number of his clubs is Mr. Alden Weir's story of passing through
London and being asked to dine by Whistler, who suggested first one
club, then another, and drove him about to half a dozen or more,
at each getting out of the cab alone and coming back to say nobody
of any account was there, or the dinner was not good, or some
other excuse; and, at last, with an apology, driving him home to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Chelsea, where a large party waited and an excellent dinner was served,
and Mr. Weir was the one guest not in evening dress, for Whistler
kept the party waiting still longer while he changed. In the
Lindsey Row days Whistler sometimes dined in a cheap French
restaurant, "good of its kind," with Albert Moore and Homer Martin,
a man he delighted in. Many artists dined there, he said, and would
sit and talk until late. "But then, you know, the sort of Englishman
who is entirely outside all these things, and likes to think he is 'in it,'
began to come too, and that ruined it."</p>

<p>To Pagani's, in Great Portland Street, a tiny place then, he went
with Pelligrini and others. He was often at the Café Royal in the
eighties with Oscar Wilde; towards the end, Mr. Heinemann, Mr.
E. G. Kennedy, and we were apt to be with him, when, if he ordered
the dinner, <i>Poulet en casserole</i> was the principal dish, and sweet champagne
the wine. Never shall we forget a dinner there, in 1899, to
Mr. Freer, who had just bought a picture. We and Mr. Heinemann
were the other guests. Much as Whistler wished to be amiable to
Mr. Freer, he was tired, and, somehow, the dinner was not right, and
there were scenes in our corner behind the screen. Mr. Freer felt
it necessary to entertain the party, which he did by talking pictures
like a new critic, and Japanese prints like a cultured school-ma'am.
Whistler slept loudly and we tried to be attentive, until at length,
at some psychological moment in Hiroshige's life or in Mr. Freer's
collection, Whistler snored such a tremendous snore that he woke
himself up, crying: "Good Heavens! Who is snoring?"</p>

<p>Whistler had the faculty of being late when invited to dinner.
One official evening, he arrived an hour after the time. "We are so
hungry, Mr. Whistler!" said his host. "What a good sign!" was
his answer. At times he felt "like a little devil," and he told us of
one of these occasions:</p>

<p>"I arrived. In the middle of the drawing-room table was the new
<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, wet from the press; in it an article on Méryon
by Wedmore, and there was Wedmore&mdash;the distinguished guest. I
felt the excitement over the great man, and the great things he had
been doing. Wedmore took the hostess in to dinner; I was on her
other side, seeing things, bent on making the most of them. And I
talked of critics, of Wedmore, as though I did not know who sat opposite.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
And I was nudged, my foot kicked under the table. But I talked.
And whenever the conversation turned on Méryon, or Wedmore's
article, or other serious things, I told another story, and I laughed&mdash;ha
ha!&mdash;and they couldn't help it, they all laughed with me, and Wedmore
was forgotten, and I was the hero of the evening. And Wedmore
has never forgiven me."</p>

<p>Whistler went a great deal to the theatre in the seventies and
eighties, and was always at first nights. Occasionally he acted in
amateur theatricals. In 1876 he played in <i>Under the Umbrella</i>, at
the Albert Hall, and was elated by a paragraph on his performance
in the <i>Daily News</i>. He showed himself at private views and at the
ceremonies society approves. To see and to be seen was part of the
social game, and the world, meeting him everywhere, mistook him
for the Butterfly for which he seemed to pose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a year after the exhibition in Pall Mall, Whistler did not show any
paintings. Artists said his pictures were not serious because not finished.
Whistler retorted that theirs "might be finished, but&mdash;well&mdash;they
never had been begun." Such remarks were not favoured by hanging
committees. Probably Royal Academicians were honest, though
malicious. Lord Redesdale remembered one whose work is forgotten,
who used to say that Whistler was losing his eyesight, that he could not
see there was no paint on his canvas. Mr. G. A. Holmes told us
that a few artists in Chelsea, though they disliked him personally,
thought him a man with new ideas who threw new light on art; Henry
Moore said to Mr. Holmes that Whistler put more atmosphere into
his pictures than any man living. But Academicians, as a rule, were
afraid of him and Whistler would tell Mr. Holmes: "Well, you know,
they want to treat me like a sheet of note-paper, and crumple me up!"</p>

<p>His prints were hung in exhibitions, many lent by Anderson Rose
to the Liverpool Art Club in October 1874, and a few months afterwards
to the Hartley Institution at Southampton. Shortly before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Liverpool show opened, Mr. Ralph Thomas issued the first catalogue
of Whistler's etchings: <i>A Catalogue of the Etchings and Dry-points of
James Abbott MacNeil Whistler, London, Privately Printed by John
Russell Smith, of 36 Soho Square</i>. Of the fifty copies printed, only
twenty-five were for sale, so that it became at once rare. Mr. Percy
Thomas etched Whistler's portrait of himself with his brushes as
frontispiece. Mr. Ralph Thomas described the plates, and as he had
been with Whistler when many were made and printed, he was far
better qualified than any of his successors. It is much to be regretted
that Wedmore did not follow Thomas's excellent beginning.</p>

<p>In 1875, Whistler exhibited pictures in the few galleries that
would hang him. In October he sent to the Winter Exhibition at
the Dudley Gallery a <i>Nocturne in Blue and Gold, No. III.</i>, which is
impossible to identify, and <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold&mdash;The Falling
Rocket</i>, which Ruskin presently identified beyond possibility of doubt:
the impression of fireworks in the gardens of Cremorne. But at the
Dudley it created no sensation. F. G. Stephens, in the <i>Athenæum</i>,
was almost alone in its praise. A month later, November 1875,
<i>Chelsea Reach&mdash;Harmony in Grey</i>, and many studies of figures on
brown paper were at the Winter Exhibition of the Society of
French Artists, and three Nocturnes in the Spring Exhibition (1876)
of the same Society. Thus Whistler managed without the Royal
Academy.</p>

<p>When Irving appeared as Philip II. in 1874, Whistler was struck
with the tall, slim, romantic figure in silvery greys and blacks, and
got him to pose. Mr. Bernhard Sickert thinks it extraordinary
that Whistler failed to suggest Irving's character. We think it more
extraordinary for Mr. Sickert to forget that Whistler was painting
Irving made up as Philip II. and not as Henry Irving. Mr. Cole
saw the picture on May 5, 1876, and found Whistler "quite madly
enthusiastic about his power of painting such full-lengths in two
sittings or so." The reproduction in M. Duret's <i>Whistler</i> differs in
so many details from the picture to-day, that at first we wondered if
two portraits were painted. M. Duret tells us that his reproduction
is from a photograph lent him by George Lucas. Probably, M.
Duret writes, the photograph was taken while Whistler was painting
the picture, which afterwards he must have altered. On comparing
the photograph carefully with the picture, we do not believe there were
two portraits, but there were many changes. In the photograph the
cloak is thrown back over the actor's right shoulder, showing his arm.
In the exhibited picture his arm is hidden by the cloak, and his hand,
which before seems to have been thrust into his doublet, rests upon
the collar of an order. The trunks, apparently, were much altered,
especially the right, and the legs are far better drawn, the left foot
entirely repainted. Though Whistler was acquiring more certainty
in putting in these big portraits at once, he was becoming more exacting,
and he made repeated changes. When the <i>Irving</i> was hung at the
Grosvenor Gallery, Mrs. Stillman remembers that three different
outlines of the figure were visible. The portrait was not a commission.
It is said that Irving refused the small price Whistler asked for it, but
later, seeing his legs sticking out from under a pile of canvases in a
Wardour Street shop, recognised them and bought the picture for
ten guineas. Mr. Bram Stoker writes that, at the time of the bankruptcy,
Whistler sold it to Irving "for either twenty or forty pounds&mdash;I
forget which." The facts are that Whistler sold the <i>Irving</i> to Howell,
for "ten pounds and a sealskin coat," Howell recorded in his diary,
and that from him it passed into the hands of Mr. Graves, the printseller
in Pall Mall, who sold it to Irving for one hundred pounds. After
Irving's death, it came up for sale at Christie's, and fetched five thousand
pounds, becoming the property of Mr. Thomas, of Philadelphia.
On the death of Mr. Thomas it was purchased for the Metropolitan
Museum in New York.</p>

<p>A portrait of Sir Henry Cole was begun this spring. Mr. Alan
S. Cole, in his diary (May 19, 1876), speaks of "a strong commencement
upon a nearly life-size portrait of my father. Looking at it reflected
in a glass, and how the figure stood within the frame." This was never
finished. Whistler's executrix says it was burned.</p>

<p>Lord Redesdale told us of a beautiful full-length of his wife in
Chinese blue silk Whistler called fair, his word then for everything he
liked. With two or three more sittings and a little work, it would have
been finished. But it was a difficult moment, men were in possession
at No. 2 Lindsey Row, and he slashed the canvas. The debt was
small, thirty pounds or so, and the price agreed upon for the portrait
was two hundred guineas. Lord Redesdale would gladly have settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the matter, but Whistler said nothing. A portrait started of Lord
Redesdale, in Van Dyck costume, and several Nocturnes were torn off
stretchers and slashed. <i>The Fur Jacket</i>, <i>Rosa Corder</i>, <i>Connie Gilchrist
with the Skipping Rope&mdash;The Gold Girl</i>, <i>Effie Deans</i>, were being painted.
<i>The Fur Jacket, Arrangement in Black and Brown</i> his final name for
it, is the portrait of Maud, Miss Franklin, who now becomes more
important in his life and in his art. It is of great dignity. The dress
is put in with a full, sweeping brush in long flowing lines, classic in the
fall of the folds; the pale, beautiful face looks out like a flower from
the depth of the background. In many portraits Whistler was rebuked
for sacrificing the face to the design; here the interest is concentrated
on the face, and that is why the shadowy figure has been criticised as
a mere ghost, a mere rub-in of colour, on the canvas. That he carried
the work as far as he thought it should be carried is certain when it
is contrasted with <i>Rosa Corder</i>, also an <i>Arrangement in Black and Brown</i>,
in which the jacket, the feathered hat in her hand, the trailing skirt,
the face in severe profile, are more solidly modelled. M. Blanche
has stated that Whistler, in Cheyne Walk, saw Miss Rosa Corder in
her brown dress pass a door painted black, and was struck with the
scheme of colour. This may be true, for, as we have shown, chance
often suggested the effect or arrangement. <i>Connie Gilchrist&mdash;The
Gold Girl</i>, a popular dancer at the Gaiety, attracted Whistler by her
stage dress, which revealed her slight girlish form in its delicate youthful
beauty. He posed her in the studio as he had seen her on the stage,
skipping. But the movement which told on the stage by its simplicity
its spontaneity, became in the picture artificial. The figure has the
elegance of the little pastels, it is placed with the distinction of the
<i>Miss Alexander</i>, but the suspended action gives the sense of incompleteness.
A long line swept down the back of the figure proves he
meant to change it.</p>

<p>The above was written before the painting was bought by George
A. Hearn and presented to the Metropolitan Museum of New York.
Whistler for years had been endeavouring to get possession of it in order
to destroy it. It had been seized at his bankruptcy, and for long was
the property of Henry Labouchere. That Whistler was dissatisfied
is shown by that long black line from the girl's head to her heels.
After it had hung for some time in the Metropolitan Museum the line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
was removed, and what is left of the picture Whistler wanted to destroy
can now be seen on the walls.</p>

<p>Always the pictures he was painting were in his mind. He memorised
them as he did the Nocturnes, and over and over, instead of telling
what he was painting, he would make, to show those he knew would
understand, pen or wash sketches of the work he was engaged on,
leaving the sketches, many of which exist, with his friends. There
are records of the kind of most of these portraits.</p>

<p>No portraits were shown in 1876, for other work engrossed him.
It was the year of The Peacock Room.</p>

<p>We do not know how he got the idea of the peacock as a motive
for decoration, or where he obtained his knowledge of it. But the
scheme was first proposed to Mr. W. C. Alexander for his house on
Campden Hill, and Whistler put down a few notes in pen and ink.
The work went no further, and he arranged, instead, a harmony in
white for the drawing-room, replaced afterwards by Eastern tapestries.
Then Leyland bought his house in Prince's Gate. Leyland's ambition
was to live the life of an ancient Venetian merchant in modern London,
and he began to remodel the interior and fill it with beautiful things.
He bought the gilded staircase from Northumberland House, which
was being pulled down. He commissioned Whistler to suggest the
colour in the hall, and paint the detail of blossom and leaf on the panels
of the dado. "To Leyland's house to see Whistler's colouring of Hall&mdash;very
delicate cocoa colour and gold&mdash;successful," Mr. Cole wrote,
March 24. Leyland covered the walls of drawing- and reception-rooms
with pictures. He had work by Filippo Lippi, Botticelli,
Crivelli. He owned Rossetti's <i>Blessed Damosel</i> and <i>Lady Lilith</i>,
Millais' <i>Eve of St. Agnes</i>, Ford Madox Brown's <i>Chaucer at King Edward's
Court</i>, Windus' <i>Burd Helen</i>, Burne-Jones' <i>Mirror of Venus</i> and <i>Wine of
Circe</i>. He bought Legros, Watts, and Albert Moore. Whistler's
<i>Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine</i> was his, and he hung it in the dining-room
amidst his splendid collection of blue and white china.</p>

<p>Norman Shaw was making the alterations to the house, and another
architect, Jeckyll, was suggested by Mr. Murray Marks to decorate
the dining-room and arrange the blue and white. Some say that
originally Morris and Burne-Jones were to do the dining-room, but
that when Whistler stepped in they vanished. Jeckyll put up shelves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to hold the china, and Whistler designed the sideboard. The <i>Princesse</i>
was placed over the mantel, and space left at the opposite end of the
room for another painting by Whistler, who wished the <i>Three Figures,
Pink and Grey</i> to face the <i>Princesse</i>. The walls were hung with Norwich
leather. The shelves were divided by perpendicular lines endlessly
repeated, and the panelled ceiling, with its pendant lamps, was heavy.
Whistler maintained that the red border of the rug and the red flowers
in the centre of each panel of the leather killed the delicate tones of
his picture. Leyland agreed. The red border was cut off the rug, and
Whistler gilded, or painted, the flowers on the leather with yellow and
gold. The result was horrible; the yellow paint and gilding "swore"
at the yellow tone of the leather. Something else must be done, and
again Leyland agreed. The something else developed into the scheme
of decoration first submitted to Mr. Alexander: The Peacock Room.</p>

<p>He told us one evening, when talking of it: "Well, you know, I
just painted as I went on, without design or sketch&mdash;it grew as I painted.
And towards the end I reached such a point of perfection&mdash;putting
in every touch with such freedom&mdash;that when I came round to the
corner where I had started, why, I had to paint part of it over again,
or the difference would have been too marked. And the harmony in
blue and gold developing, you know, I forgot everything in my joy
in it!"</p>

<p>He had planned a journey to Venice, and new series of etchings
there and in France and Holland. The journey was postponed. At
the end of the season, the Leylands went to Speke Hall. Whistler
remained at Prince's Gate. Town emptied, he was still there, spending
his days on ladders and scaffolding, or lying in a hammock painting.
His two pupils helped him: "We laid on the gold," Mr. Walter
Greaves says, and there were times when the three were found with
their hair and faces covered with it. Whistler's description of this
whirlwind of work was "the show's afire," an expression he used for
years when things were going. He was up before six, at Prince's
Gate an hour or so after, at noon jumping into a hansom and driving
home to lunch, then hurrying back to his work. At night he was fit for
nothing but bed, "so full were my eyes of sleep and peacock feathers,"
he told us. He thought only of the beauty growing in his hands.
Autumn came. Lionel Robinson and Sir Thomas Sutherland, with
whom he was to have gone to Venice, started without him. He could
not drop the work at Prince's Gate.</p>

<p>A record of his progress is in the short notes of Mr. Cole's
diary:</p>

<p>"<i>September 11</i> (1876). Whistler dined. Most entertaining with
his brilliant description of his successful decorations at Leyland's.</p>

<p>"<i>September 20.</i> To see Peacock Room. Peacock feather devices&mdash;blues
and golds&mdash;extremely new and original.</p>

<p>"<i>October 26.</i> To see room which is developing. The dado and
panels greatly help it. Met Poynter, who spoke highly of Whistler's
decoration.</p>

<p>"<i>October 27.</i> Again to see room with Moody. He did not like
the varnished surface and blocky manner of laying on the gold.</p>

<p>"<i>October 29.</i> To Peacock Room. Mitford (Lord Redesdale) came.</p>

<p>"<i>November 10.</i> The blue over the brown (leather) background
is most admirable in effect, and the ornament in gold on blue fine.
W. quite mad with excitement.</p>

<p>"<i>November 20.</i> With Prince Teck to see Whistler and the room.
Left P. T. with Jimmy.</p>

<p>"<i>November 29.</i> Golden Peacocks promise to be superb.</p>

<p>"<i>December 4.</i> Peacocks superb.</p>

<p>"<i>December 8.</i> Article in <i>Morning Post</i> on Peacock Room.</p>

<p>"<i>December 9.</i> Whistler in a state over article in <i>Morning Post</i>.
Leyland much perturbed as I heard.</p>

<p>"<i>December 15.</i> Whistler now thinking of cutting off the pendant
ceiling lamps in Peacock Room.</p>

<p>"<i>December 17.</i> My father and Probyn to see room. Jimmy much
disgusted at my father's telling him that, in taking so much pains over
his work, and in the minuteness of his etched work, he really was like
Mulready, who was equally scrupulous."</p>

<p>Lord Redesdale told us that, returning from Scotland, he went
to Prince's Gate. Whistler was on top of a ladder, looking like a little
imp&mdash;a gnome.</p>

<p>"But what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I am doing the loveliest thing you ever saw!"</p>

<p>"But what of the beautiful old Spanish leather? And Leyland?
Have you consulted him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should I? I am doing the most beautiful thing that ever
has been done, you know, the most beautiful room!"</p>

<p>Everybody wanted to see it. Whistler held a succession of receptions
at Prince's Gate. He was flattered when the Princess Louise
and the Marquis of Westminster came, he wrote to his mother at
Hastings, for they set the fashion, kept up the talk in London. Boughton
said in his <i>Reminiscences</i>: "He often asked me round to The Peacock
Room, and I see him still up on high, lying on his back often, working
in 'gold on blue' and 'blue on gold' over the whole expanse of the
ceiling, and, as far as I could see, he let no hand touch it but his own."
Mrs. Stillman, however, remembers the two pupils working while she
drank tea with Whistler. Lady Ritchie let us have her impressions
of a visit:</p>

<p>"Long, long after the Paris days, Mr. Whistler danced when I
would rather have talked. Some one, I cannot remember who, it was
probably one of Mr. Cole's family, told me one day when I was walking
up Prince's Gate that he was decorating a house by which we were
passing, and asked me if I should like to go in. We found ourselves&mdash;it
was like a dream&mdash;in a beautiful Peacock Room, full of lovely lights and
tints, and romantic, dazzling effects. James Whistler, in a painter's
smock, stood at one end of the room at work. Seeing us, he laid
down his brushes, and greeted us warmly, and I talked of old
Paris days to him. 'I used to ask you to dance,' he said, 'but you
liked talking best.' To which I answered, 'No, indeed, I liked dancing
best,' and suddenly I found myself whirling half-way down the room."</p>

<p>Jeckyll came, and his visit was tragic. When he saw what had been
done to his work, he hurried home, gilded his floor, and forgot his grief
in a mad-house.</p>

<p>Whistler received the critics on February 9, 1877. A leaflet, for
distribution, was written, it is said, by Whistler, though the wording
does not suggest it, and printed by Thomas Way. It explains that,
with the Peacocks as motive, two patterns, derived from the eyes
and the breast feathers, were invented and repeated throughout,
sometimes one alone, sometimes both in combination; along the dado,
blue on gold, over the walls, gold on blue, while the arrangement was
completed by the birds, painted in their splendour, in blue on the
gold shutters, in gold on the blue space opposite the chimney-place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
"Called and found Whistler elated with the praises of the Press of The
Peacock Room," is Mr. Cole's note on the 18th of the month. Even
then it was not finished. On March 5, Mr. Cole was "late at Prince's
Gate with Whistler, consoling him. He trying to finish the peacocks
on shutters. With him till 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and walked home."</p>

<p>Whistler made no change in the architectural construction of the
room. It was far from beautiful, with its perpendicular lines, its
heavy ceiling, its hanging lamps, and its spaces so broken up that only
on the wall opposite the <i>Princesse</i> and on the shutters could he carry out
his design in its full splendour and stateliness, and give gorgeousness of
form as well as colour; only there could he paint the peacocks that were
his motive, so that it is by artificial light, with the shutters closed, that
the room is seen in completeness. He could do no more than adapt
in marvellous fashion the eye of the peacock, the throat and breast
feathers to the broken surfaces. But in spite of drawbacks, The Peacock
Room is the "noble work" he called it to his mother, the one perfect
mural decoration of modern times. It was his first chance, and it is
a lasting reproach to his contemporaries that there was no one to offer
him another until too late.</p>

<p>Whistler, who in his pictures avoided literary themes, resorted
to symbolism in his gold peacocks on the wall facing the <i>Princesse</i>. One,
standing amid flying feathers and gold, clutches in his claws a pile of
coins; the other spreads his wings in angry but triumphant defiance:
"the Rich Peacock and the Poor Peacock," Whistler said, symbolising
the relations between patron and artist.</p>

<p>Leyland had been away from Prince's Gate for months. He had
seen his beautiful leather disappear beneath Whistler's blue and gold.
He had heard of receptions and press views to which no invitations
had been issued by him or to him, and he was annoyed at having his
private house turned into a public gallery. The crisis came when
Whistler, thinking himself justified by months of work, asked two
thousand guineas for the decoration of the room. Leyland, who had
sanctioned only the retouching of the leather, could restrain himself
no longer. Like many generous men, he had a strict, if narrow, sense
of justice. The original understanding was that Whistler should receive
five hundred guineas. This grew to a thousand as the scheme developed.
But when, at the end, Whistler demanded two thousand, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
was no contract, Leyland sent Whistler one thousand pounds, not even
guineas. To Whistler this was an insult. He felt he had been treated
not as an artist, but as a tradesman. He never forgave Leyland, though,
at one moment, Leyland was prepared to pay the whole sum if Whistler
would leave the house. Whistler refused, preferring to make Leyland
a gift of the decoration than not finish the panel of the Peacocks, and
he told Mr. Cole:</p>

<p>"You know, there Leyland will sit at dinner, his back to the
<i>Princesse</i>, and always before him the apotheosis of <i>l'art et l'argent</i>!"</p>

<p>And this was what happened. Leyland knew that, in return for the
loss of his leather and his irritation with Whistler, he had been given
something beautiful, and he kept the dining-room as Whistler left it,
toning down not a flying feather, not a piece of gold in that triumphant
caricature. Until the colour fades from the panel, the world cannot
forget the quarrel. Whistler never forgot it, and his resentment
against Leyland never lessened. It may be that he was over-sensitive,
certainly he put himself in the wrong by his conduct to Leyland. But
he could no more help his manner of avenging what he thought an
insult, than the meek man can refrain from turning the other cheek
to the chastiser. It will ever be to Leyland's credit that he left the
work alone.</p>

<p>A few years ago the room was removed from the house in Prince's
Gate, bought by Messrs. Brown and Phillips, sold by them to Messrs.
Obach, who exhibited it in their Bond Street gallery, and it was then
purchased by Mr. Charles L. Freer and taken to Detroit. As he
owns the <i>Princesse</i>, The Peacock Room is probably once again just as
it was when Whistler finished it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII: THE GROSVENOR GALLERY.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-SEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> exhibitions had been organised in opposition to the Royal
Academy, but on too small a scale to contend against that rich and
powerful institution. Sir Coutts Lindsay, the founder of the Grosvenor
Gallery, brought to it money, a talent for organisation, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
determination to show the best work in the right way. Nothing could
have been more in accord with Whistler's ideas. He dropped in to
smoke with Mr. Cole on the evening of March 19, 1876, "in great
excitement over Sir Coutts Lindsay's gallery for pictures&mdash;very select
exhibition, which he carried to an extreme by saying that it might be
opened with only one picture worthy of being shown that season."
Sir Coutts Lindsay proposed to exhibit no pictures save those he invited,
and he might have succeeded had he ignored the Academy, and made
the Grosvenor as distinct from it as the International Society of Sculptors,
Painters and Gravers was under Whistler's presidency. He had the
daring to invite Whistler, Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Holman Hunt, Walter
Crane, Watts; but the weakness to include Millais, Alma-Tadema,
Poynter, Richmond, Leighton. "To those whose work he wanted, he
gave little dinners," Mr. Hallé has told us, and a very strange lot some
of them seemed to Sir Coutts probably, to his butler certainly. One
evening the butler could endure it no longer, and he came into the
drawing-room and whispered: "There's a gent downstairs says 'e 'as
come to dinner, wot's forgot 'is necktie and stuck a fevver in his 'air,"
for at this period Whistler, Mr. Hallé says, never wore a necktie when
in evening dress. The white lock bewildered others. Mrs. Leyland
remembered his going to her box at the opera once, where the
attendant leaned over and said: "Beg your pardon, sir, but there's
a white feather in your hair, just on top!"</p>

<p>At first, Burne-Jones and the followers of the Pre-Raphaelites were
most in evidence at Sir Coutts Lindsay's exhibitions, and the "greenery-yallery,
Grosvenor Gallery" element prevailed. But the Grosvenor,
by the time its traditions were taken over by the New Gallery, was little
more than an overflow from the Academy.</p>

<p>Shortly before the first exhibition in 1877, Whistler's brother,
the doctor, was married to Miss Helen Ionides, a cousin of Aleco
and Luke Ionides. The wedding (April 17, 1877) was at St. George's,
Hanover Square, and the Greek Church, London Wall. It brought
to Whistler a good friend for the troubled years that were to come,
and Mrs. Whistler's house in Wimpole Street was for long a home to
him.</p>

<p>The first Grosvenor was a loan exhibition, and opened in May 1877.
Whistler sent <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold&mdash;The Falling Rocket</i> shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
at the Dudley; <i>Harmony in Amber and Black</i>, the first title of <i>The
Fur Jacket; Arrangement in Brown</i>; Irving as Philip II. of Spain,
with the title <i>Arrangement in Black, No. III</i>. From Mrs. Leyland
came <i>Nocturne in Blue and Silver</i>; from Mr. W. Graham another
<i>Nocturne in Blue and Silver</i>&mdash;changed later by Whistler to <i>Blue and
Gold, Old Battersea Bridge</i>, now at the Tate Gallery; from the Hon.
Mrs. Percy Wyndham, <i>Nocturne in Blue and Gold</i>, at Westminster. The
<i>Carlyle</i> was included, but it arrived too late to be catalogued. Boehm
lent his bust of Whistler in terra-cotta, done in 1872, considered at the
time a good portrait.</p>

<p>Whistler's work was also seen in a frieze, described by Mr. Walter
Crane: "Whistler designed the frieze&mdash;the phases of the moon on the
coved ceiling of the West Gallery which has disappeared since its
conversion into the Æolian Hall, with stars on a subdued blue ground,
the moon and stars being brought out in silver, the frieze being divided
into panels by the supports of the glass roof. The 'phases' were
sufficiently separated from each other."</p>

<p>We have heard of this decoration from no one else. Probably
it was overshadowed by the crimson silk damask and green velvet hangings,
the gilded pilasters and furniture, the monumental chimneypiece,
of which complaints were heard from every side. The sumptuousness
of the background was disastrous to the pictures. Whistler's
suffered less than others, but were not liked the more on that account.
Before the private view (April 30, 1877), Sir Coutts Lindsay had
expressed his disappointment in the <i>Irving</i> and the Nocturnes. At the
private view the crowd gathered in front of Alma-Tadema, Burne-Jones,
Millais, Leighton, Poynter, Richmond. The critics sneered
at Whistler, or patronised him. The <i>Athenæum</i> grudged meagre
lines to this "whimsical, if capable, artist and his vagaries." The
<i>Times</i> smiled with condescension at "Mr. Whistler's compartment,
musical with strange Nocturnes," wondered how Irving enjoyed
"being reduced to a mere arrangement," and deplored the theory
that, in practice, covered "an entire absence of details, even details
generally considered so important to a full-length portrait as arms and
legs. In fact, Mr. Whistler's full-length arrangements suggest to us a
choice between materialised spirits and figures in a London fog."</p>

<p>But no criticism was so insolent as the notice of the Grosvenor which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Ruskin delivered from his circulating pulpit, <i>Fors Clavigera</i> (July 2,
1877).</p>

<p>Ruskin, though social subjects engrossed him, was still the art critic
powerful to the public, to himself infallible. He had made the
Pre-Raphaelites, he set to work to unmake Whistler. Already he was
attacked by the mental malady, the "morbid excitement" in Mr.
Collingwood's words, that obscured the last years of his life; he had
been very ill in the winter of 1877. Nothing else could pardon his
malice and insolence. He reserved his chief abuse for Whistler's
<i>Falling Rocket at Cremorne</i>, with the sudden burst of fire and shower
of gold and detail disappearing in the illimitable darkness of night.
That fireworks in a place of entertainment could have in them the
elements of beauty was a truth Ruskin could not grasp, and with
this wonderful canvas before him, he remained blind to the splendour
of the subject and the mastery of the painter: "I have seen and
heard much of cockney impudence before now, but never expected
to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of
paint in the public's face."</p>

<p>Boughton, in his <i>Reminiscences</i>, tells that Whistler first chanced
upon this criticism when they were alone together in the smoking-room
of the Arts Club. "It is the most debased style of criticism I have had
thrown at me yet," Whistler said. "Sounds rather like libel," Boughton
suggested. "Well&mdash;that I shall try to find out!" Whistler
replied.</p>

<p>Till now, his answer to abuse of his work had been the lash of his wit.
But if critics had tried him by their stupidity, never, before Ruskin,
had they outraged him by their venom. The insult appeared in a
widely read print; he sought redress in the most public fashion possible
in England, and sued Ruskin for libel.</p>

<p>The immediate result was that he found it harder to sell his pictures.
To buy his Nocturnes was to be ridiculed, Mr. Rawlinson, one of the
few who risked it, assures us. Whistler laughed away the new anxiety,
and devoted more time to black-and-white. He had hoped to go to
Venice, but the preparations for the trial kept him in London. And
now Howell made himself as useful to Whistler as he had been to
Rossetti:</p>

<p>"Well, you, know, it happened one summer evening, in those old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
days when there was real summer, I was sitting looking out of the
window in Lindsey Row, and there was Howell passing, and Rosa Corder
was with him. And I called to them and they came in, and Howell
said: 'Why, you have etched many plates, haven't you? You must
get them out, you must print them, you must let me see to them&mdash;there's
gold waiting. And you have a press!' And so I had, in a
room upstairs, only it was rusty, it hadn't been used for so long. But
Howell wouldn't listen to an objection. He said he would fix up the
press, he would pull it. And there was no escape. And the next
morning, there we all were, Rosa Corder, too, and Howell was pulling
at the wheel, and there were basins of water, and paper being damped,
and prints being dried, and then Howell was grinding more ink, and,
with the plates under my fingers, I felt all the old love of it come back.
In the afternoon Howell would go and see Graves, the printseller,
and there were orders flying about, and cheques&mdash;it was all amazing,
you know! Howell profited, of course. But he was so superb. One
evening we had left a pile of eleven prints just pulled, and the next
morning only five were there. 'It's very strange,' Howell said, 'we
must have a search. No one could have taken them but me, and that,
you know, is impossible!'" There is a record of this period in the
etching, <i>Lady at a Window</i>, with Rosa Corder, or Maud, by the garret
window, looking at a print, the press behind her.</p>

<p>It was a period of what he called his "fiendish slavery to the press."
There were new plates. In 1878 <i>St. James's Street</i> was reproduced by
lithography in the "Season Number" of <i>Vanity Fair</i>. The <i>Athenæum</i>
objected to it because it was "not done as Leech or Hogarth would have
done it." The <i>World</i> mistook the reproduction for the original, and
so invited from Whistler one of the letters following each other fast:
"Atlas has the wisdom of ages, and need not grieve himself with mere
matters of art." <i>Adam and Eve&mdash;Old Chelsea</i> has a special interest,
for it marks the transition from his early manner in the Thames Set
to the later handling in the Venetian. A plate was made from the <i>Irving
as Philip of Spain</i>, the only portrait Whistler reproduced on copper,
and it was not a success. His plates of Jo and Maud were never from
pictures, though often studies for pictures he proposed to paint. The
dry-point of his <i>Mother</i> has no relation to the portrait. He was
bored to death with copying himself, he would say, and, twenty years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
afterwards, when he undertook a lithograph of his <i>Montesquiou</i> and
failed, he said that "it was impossible to produce the same masterpiece
twice over," that "the inspiration would not come," that when he
was not working at a new thing from Nature he was not applying himself,
"it was as difficult as for a hen to lay the same egg twice."</p>

<p>In 1878 he made his first experiments in lithography. His attention
had been called to it by Mr. Thomas Way, who did more than any other
man to revive the art in England. Lithography, appropriated by commerce,
was almost forgotten as a means of artistic expression. In France,
it was given over for cheaper and quicker methods of illustration; in
England it was overweighted by the ponderous performances of Haghe
and Nash, hedged about by trade unions, and reduced to the perfection
of commonplace. Lithographers here and there preserved its best
traditions and regretted the degradation. Mr. Thomas Way determined
to interest artists again in a medium that had yielded such
splendid results. He prepared stones for them, explained processes,
and would not hear of difficulties. Some artists experimented, but
lithography did not pay while the anecdote in paint fetched a fortune.
Mr. Way appealed to Whistler, who tried the stone, grasped its possibilities,
and was delighted. In his first five lithographs he did things
never attempted before and found the medium adapted to him. He
made nine this year on the stone, though his later work was mostly
done on lithographic paper. He proposed to publish this first series
as <i>Art Notes</i>, but there was no demand, and the plan fell through.
<i>The Toilet</i> and the <i>Broad Bridge</i> were printed in <i>Piccadilly</i> (1878), edited
by Mr. Watts-Dunton, and they had hardly appeared when the magazine
came to an end. Neither Whistler nor lithography then meant
success for any enterprise.</p>

<p>In 1878, the <i>Catalogue of Blue and White Nankin Porcelain Forming
the Collection of Sir Henry Thompson</i> was published. Mr. Murray
Marks and Mr. W. C. Alexander own delicate little designs of blue and
white by Whistler for Mr. Marks, but never used. They were a good
preparation for the drawings which, in collaboration with Sir Henry
Thompson, he made to illustrate the Catalogue. Some are in brown,
some in blue, reproduced by the Autotype Company. Nineteen of the
twenty-six are by Whistler, simple and direct, the modelling in the
drawing by the brush as the Japanese would have given it. As a rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
there are neither shadows nor attempts at relief. The series is a refutation
of the assertion that he could not draw. Whenever he attempted
drawing of this sort, or etchings like <i>The Wine Glass</i>, he eclipsed Jacquemart
and all his contemporaries. Worried, anxious, the libel case
hanging over him, his debts increasing, the general distrust in his work
growing, Whistler, nevertheless, gave to the catalogue his usual care.
We have seen another set of the drawings, which differ slightly from
those reproduced, and with which, evidently, he was not satisfied. The
book was edited by Mr. Murray Marks, and issued by Messrs. Ellis and
White, of 29 New Bond Street, in May, and Mr. Marks exhibited the
drawings and the porcelain, with the book, in his shop, 395 Oxford
Street. The show was not a success, the book was a loss, though
only two hundred and twenty copies were printed. Now it is almost
impossible to get.</p>

<p>Of personal notice, Whistler had more than enough. He was
caricatured this year in <i>The Grasshopper</i> at the Gaiety&mdash;it was in the
days of Edward Terry and Nellie Farren. A large full-length, thought
by many more a portrait than a caricature, was painted by Carlo
Pellegrini, an Italian artist who lived in England and, under the names
of "Singe" and "Ape," contributed to <i>Vanity Fair</i> caricatures which,
unlike the characterless, artless scrawls of his more popular amateur
successors, were works of art and, therefore, appreciated by Whistler.
The painting shows Whistler in evening dress, no necktie, and a gold
chain to his monocle; and in a scene parodying the studios and artists
of the day, it was pushed in on an easel, some say by Pellegrini, with
the announcement, "Here is the inventor of black-and-white!" It
was a failure, and no wonder. It was impossible to see the point. The
painting now belongs to Mr. John W. Simpson of New York. Whistler
was also caricatured in <i>Vanity Fair</i> by "Spy," Leslie Ward, then
rapidly rivalling "Ape" in popularity, and to be so caricatured was,
in London, to achieve notoriety.</p>

<p>To the second Grosvenor in 1878 he sent, in defiance to Ruskin,
another series of Nocturnes, Harmonies, and Arrangements. Among
them was the <i>Arrangement in White and Black, No. I.</i>, the large, full-length
portrait of Miss Maud Franklin, that sometimes figures in
catalogues and articles as <i>L'Américaine</i>. We believe it was never shown
in England again. It passed in the early eighties into the collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of Dr. Linde, at Lübeck, where it remained until 1904, was then sold
through Paris dealers to an American, and remains one of the least
known of Whistler's large full-lengths. We saw it in the spring of
1904 at M. Duret's apartment in the Rue Vignon. It is the only
portrait, except the <i>Connie Gilchrist</i> and The <i>Yellow Buskin</i>, in
which Whistler attempted to give movement to the figure. Miss
Franklin wears a white gown in the ugly fashion of the late seventies,
and walks forward, one hand on her hip, the other holding up her
skirt. But she fails to fulfil Whistler's precept that the figure
must keep within the frame. She seems walking out of the depths
of the background, breaking through the envelope of atmosphere.
The problem was difficult, an unusual one for Whistler, and, interesting
as is the result, the portrait hardly ranks with the greatest. When
shown in 1878, it did not help to reconcile the critics. The <i>Athenæum</i>
said: "Mr. Whistler is in great force. Last year some of his life-size
portraits were without feet; here we have a curiously shaped young
lady, ostentatiously showing her foot, which is a pretty large one."
It was a "vaporous full-length" in the opinion of the <i>Times</i>, babbling
nonsense about the Nocturnes and glad to turn from Whistler's "diet
of fog to the broad table of substantial landscape spread for us by Cecil
G. Lawson." Whistler contributed a drawing of the <i>Arrangement in
White and Black</i> to Blackburn's <i>Grosvenor Notes</i>, an illustrated catalogue
published for the first time in 1878. For many years Whistler made
these little sketches in pen and ink after his pictures for illustrated
catalogues, and for papers that illustrated notices of the exhibitions,
an aid to the identification of works where the titles fail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII: THE WHITE HOUSE.<br />THE YEAR EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1878, Whistler's only exhibit was
the section of a room that may have been his design for Mr. Alexander,
or more likely was his decoration for the White House which E. W.
Godwin, the architect, was building for him in Tite Street, Chelsea.
He called it a <i>Harmony in Yellow and Gold</i>, and others spoke of it as
the <i>Primrose Room</i>. It seems to have been simply a room painted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
gold and yellow, the peacock pattern again used, but this time in gold
on yellow and yellow on gold. There was simple furniture in yellow
of a darker tone than the walls, also a chimneypiece which, twelve
years or so afterwards, was found by Mr. Pickford Waller in a second-hand
furniture shop and bought. The stove was taken out; two panels,
with a pattern suggested for the dado, were turned into doors, and
the chimneypiece is now a cabinet with Whistler's decorations almost
untouched.</p>

<p>A few years ago Messrs. Obach had in their possession a set of glass
panels for a door from the house of Anderson Rose, stated to be by
Whistler, but there is no evidence of Whistler's work in them. Recently
a set of Empire chairs were shown in New York said to have been decorated
by Whistler for Wickham Flower, and so described at Christie's
where they were sold, but Messrs. Christie do not guarantee the articles
in their sales. To those who know Whistler's work there was no trace
of it in the chairs, and we have it on Mrs. Flower's authority that the
decorations were by Henry Treffy Dunn.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan Ford, in the suppressed edition of <i>The Gentle Art</i>,
writes that, at Sir Thomas Sutherland's request, Whistler designed a
scheme of decoration for his house, but that its "startling novelty
caused such evident anxiety," Whistler carried it no further. Some
houses he did decorate later on&mdash;those of Mrs. William Whistler, Mr.
William Heinemann, Senor Sarasate, Mrs. Walter Sickert, Mrs. D'Oyly
Carte, Mr. Menpes. But the decoration was simply the colour-scheme.
Whistler mixed the colour, which was usually put on by
house-painters. He frequently suggested the furniture, but of design,
as in The Peacock Room, there was nothing, not even in any of his
own houses after the White House. To one friend, thinking of decorating,
who asked his advice, his answer was, "Well, first burn all your
furniture." Often he gave elaborate directions as to what colours
should be used and how they were to be applied. Mrs. D'Oyly Carte
wrote us:</p>

<p>"It would not be quite correct to say that Mr. Whistler designed
the decorations of my house, because it is one of the old Adam houses
in Adelphi Terrace, and it contained the original Adam ceiling in the
drawing-room and a number of the old Adam mantelpieces, which
Mr. Whistler much admired, as he did also some of the cornices, doors
and other things. What he did do was to design a colour-scheme for
the house, and he mixed the colours for distempering the walls in each
case, leaving only the painters to <i>apply</i> them. In this way he got the
exact shade he wanted, which made all the difference, as I think the
difficulty in getting any painting satisfactorily done is that painters
simply have their stock shades which they show you to choose from,
and none of them seem to be the kind of shades that Mr. Whistler
managed to achieve by the mixing of his ingredients. He distempered
the whole of the staircase light pink; the dining-room a different and
deeper shade; the library he made one of those yellows he had in his
drawing-room at the Vale, a sort of primrose which seemed as if the sun
was shining, however dark the day, and he painted the woodwork with
it green, but not like the ordinary painters' green at all. He followed
the same scheme in the other rooms. His idea was to make the house
gay and delicate in colour."</p>

<p>When he left No. 2 Lindsey Row he suggested the colour arrangement
throughout the house for the new tenants, Mr. and Mrs. Sydney
Morse, got his man Cossens to do the distempering, and, Mrs. Morse
writes us, "was so afraid that we should do it wrongly that he personally
superintended the work and mixed the colour himself, though in consequence
of this a whole wash for the dining-room was spoilt, as
he forgot to stir it up at the right moment. There was great discussion
about gold size."</p>

<p>To decoration Whistler applied his scientific method of painting,
and on his walls, as in his pictures, black was often the basis. Colour
for him was as much decoration as pattern was for William Morris, and
in the use of flat colour for wall decoration Whistler has triumphed.
His theory of interior decoration, though people do not realise it, has
been universally adopted, even his use of distemper, in which he was
only carrying on the beautiful tradition of whitewashing walls. Not
only can this simple scheme be made more appropriate as a background
than Morris' hangings and stencillings, but it has the virtue of utility
and cheapness, which Morris for ever preached but never practised. In
the painting of pictures, the idea of the Pre-Raphaelites was decoration&mdash;that
is, convention. Their decoration was either wilfully or ignorantly
founded on the realism of the Middle Ages. The great decorators
of Italy were the realists of their day, their realism, except in the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the greatest, Piero della Francesca, is now regarded as convention,
and it is the Pre-Raphaelites who stirred up these dead bones. In
France, Puvis de Chavannes developed Italian methods, adapting them
to modern subjects and modern wants, retaining the convention of
flatness and simplicity. Whistler believed that a portrait or a Nocturne
should be as decorative as a conventional design; that, by the arrangement
of his subjects, and by their colour, they should be made decorative,
and not by conventional setting and conventional lines. He also
believed that walls should be in flat tones and not covered with pattern.
Pictures then placed upon them were shown properly and did not
struggle with the pattern. Lady Archibald Campbell writes us a few
lines proving that he could make people understand his aims when they
were willing to learn from him:</p>

<p>"The fundamental principles of decorative art with which Whistler
impressed me, related to the necessity of applying scientific methods
to the treatment of all decorative work; that to produce harmonious
effects in line and colour grouping, the whole plan or scheme should
have to be thoroughly thought out so as to be <i>finished</i> before it was
practically begun. I think he proved his saying to be true, that the
fundamental principles of decorative art, as in all art, are based on
laws as exact as those of the known sciences. He concluded that what
the knowledge of a fundamental base has done for music, a similarly
demonstrative method must do for painting. The musical vocabulary
which he used to distinguish his creations always struck me as singularly
appropriate, though he had no knowledge of music."</p>

<p>Before the Ruskin case came into court, the idea of opening an
<i>atelier</i> for students occurred to Whistler, and it was because the painting-room
at No. 2 Lindsey Row was too small that he asked Godwin to
build the house, ever since known as the White House, in Tite Street.
Up to this time he had never had a studio in Chelsea. His pictures
had been painted in rooms without a top-light, partly, no doubt, that he
might paint his sitters under natural conditions. Even in his later
studios of the Rue Notre-Dame des Champs in Paris, and Fitzroy
Street in London, shades and screens were drawn so that the light
might come in as from an ordinary window. He was trying to put
the figure into the atmosphere that surrounded it, not to cut it
out of this atmosphere. But he needed more space for the <i>atelier
</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
which promised success. Among artists, there were always a few
who believed in Whistler. Duranty only expressed the prevailing
feeling when, in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> (1878), he referred to
Whistler's influence on British painters represented in the Universal
Exhibition.</p>

<p>The White House, low, three-storeyed, simple in ornament, is modest
compared to many houses in Tite Street. It has been much changed,
but the general plan survives. When it was built, it shared the fate,
of everything associated with Whistler. The white brick of the walls,
the green slate of the roof, the stone facings, the blue door and woodwork
were as "eccentric" and "fantastic" as Whistler himself to
art-critical journalists. To architectural papers they were the cause
of debate and calling of names. To the Metropolitan Board of Works
the simplicity of design was suspiciously plain, and mouldings in specified
places were insisted upon in return for the licence to build. Discussion
followed discussion, because the studio was the most important
feature of the interior and placed at the top of the house, because windows
and doors were made where they were wanted "and not with
Baker Street regularity," because Godwin and Whistler liked the lovely
effect of the green tiles with the white walls. Harry Quilter, who
bought the house in 1879 and altered it, probably ruined the colour-scheme
which Whistler had arranged, and the interior decoration, if it
was ever carried out, does not now exist.</p>

<p>Whistler's tenancy of the Lindsey Row house came to an end on
June 25 (1878), but he could not leave it in time for the new tenants.
He did not get out of the studio until October. It was surprising that
he moved at all. The moment was one of debts and difficulties. He
was alone. His mother was ill at Hastings, he had just broken his
engagement with Leyland's sister-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and he had quarrelled with
Leyland. The criticism of the last few years told severely upon the
sale of his pictures&mdash;upon himself. Howell, who had "started cheques
and orders flying about" and attended to business details, kept a diary
during part of 1877 and all of 1878. To look through it is to share
Whistler's indignation that so great an artist should be reduced to such
shifts. In Kensington and St. John's Wood palaces, Academicians
could not turn pictures out fast enough for the competing crowd;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>Whistler was often compelled to borrow a few shillings. There are
legends of his taking a hansom and driving to find somebody to lend
him half a crown to pay for it, and before he had found anybody and
could get rid of the cab the fare had mounted to half a guinea. Howell's
diary shows that he had to raise money before he could lend it to
Whistler. Sometimes larger sums than he could manage were arranged
by Anderson Rose, Whistler's patron and solicitor. As "ill and
worried," Howell describes Whistler on one of the visits to Mr. Rose,
and there was every reason he should be. A Mr. Blott figures in other
transactions. Whistler's letters to him have been sold and published,
and it would be useless to ignore their relations. Money for the White
House had to be obtained. To Mr. Blott he gave his <i>Carlyle</i> as security
for a hundred and fifty pounds, agreeing to pay interest, offering other
pictures as security if a sum of four hundred could be advanced.
Cheques were protested, writs were threatened. The pictures he
could not sell went wandering about as hostages. The <i>Mother</i> for
awhile was with Mrs. Noseda, the Strand printseller. We have heard
that she would have sold it for a hundred pounds. Mr. Rawlinson,
who saw it either there or at Mr. Graves', has told us that nobody
could have bought it under such circumstances, after having seen
it in Whistler's bedroom, where it had hung and been shown by him
with reverence. When Whistler heard that Mrs. Noseda was offering
the picture for this price, he is said to have gone at once to remonstrate,
and by his vehemence to have made her ill.</p>

<p>One man who helped him through these troubled times was
Henry Graves, head of the firm in Pall Mall. Graves, introduced
to Whistler by Howell, agreed to engrave the portrait of Carlyle in
mezzotint, and Howell bought the copyright of the engraving from
Whistler for eighty pounds and six proofs. W. Josey was commissioned
to make the plate. Three hundred signed proofs of a first state were
to be printed. The plate would not stand so large an edition; it was
steel-faced and, as the steel-facing of mezzotint was not possible,
turned out a failure. The attempt to remove the steel ruined the
ground, and Josey had to be called in to go over it again. In the first
state, the floor was perfectly smooth, but, the steel-facing taken off, a
spot appeared in the plate which never could be got out and remained
there through the edition. After every seventy proofs printed, Josey
had to work on the plate and bring it back, as well as he could, to its
original condition. Whistler did not like the first proofs and offered
to show the printers how to do them. Mr. A. Graves went with him to
Holdgate's, the printer, in London Street. Whistler brought his own
ink, put on an apron, inked the plate as he would an etched one, while
the whole shop looked on. When the plate, wiped and ready, was put
through the press, it came out a shadow, the ink being far too weak.
Whistler did not try a second time. Mr. Graves preserved the proof,
writing on it that Whistler pulled it, and sold it for three guineas,
to whom he does not remember. Eventually Whistler was satisfied,
for Howell, on December 2, 1878, gave Whistler what he calls his first
proof, and the diary says: "Whistler and the Doctor were delighted."
It is also recorded in the diary that one of Whistler's six proofs was sold
to Lord Beaconsfield.</p>

<p>The print of the <i>Carlyle</i> was very successful. At Howell's suggestion,
Graves agreed to give Whistler a thousand pounds for a portrait
of Disraeli, and the copyright: a plate to be made from it also.</p>

<p>Mr. Alan S. Cole says Whistler went to see Disraeli:</p>

<p>"<i>September 19</i> (1878). Called on J., who told me of his interview
with Lord Beaconsfield as to painting a portrait of him. He had been
down at Hughenden&mdash;saw the old gentleman, who, however, declined."</p>

<p>Whistler's version was:</p>

<p>"Everything was most wonderful. We were the two artists
together&mdash;recognising each other at a glance! 'If I sit to any one,
it will be to you, Mr. Whistler,' were Disraeli's last words as he left
me at the gate. And then he sat to Millais!"</p>

<p>This scheme falling through, Graves commissioned Josey to engrave
the <i>Mother</i>, and afterwards the <i>Rosa Corder</i>, painted as a commission
from Howell. Whistler told us he offered the portrait as a
present to Howell, who declined and insisted on paying a hundred
guineas for it, the amount entered in Howell's diary as paid to Whistler
on September 9, 1878. It was sold to R. A. Canfield in 1903 for two
thousand pounds, and now belongs to Mr. Henry C. Frick. Though
these mezzotints were successful when published, collectors thought
as little of them as they did at the time of those of a century earlier,
and for years proofs signed by both artist and engraver could be picked
up for less than the published price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>After the two pictures had been engraved by Josey, Howell
deposited in the same way three of the Nocturnes with Graves:
<i>The Falling Rocket</i>, <i>The Fire Wheel</i>, <i>Old Battersea Bridge&mdash;Blue and
Gold</i>, and also <i>The Fur Jacket</i>. These pictures were not engraved.
Whistler had not a minute to spare from legal troubles and impatient
creditors. "Poor J. turned up depressed&mdash;very hard up, and fearful
of getting old," Mr. Cole wrote in his diary for October 16, 1878.
Whistler had reason for depression. It was now that Howell's diary
records his purchase of the <i>Irving</i> for ten pounds and a sealskin coat.
There is nothing more tragic in the story of Rembrandt's bankruptcy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX: THE TRIAL.<br />THE YEAR EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> action Whistler <i>v.</i> Ruskin, was heard on November 25-26, 1878.</p>

<p>John Ruskin, leader of taste, critic of art, prophet, and propounder
of the gospel of "the Beautiful," led not only a devout following,
but that enormous public which believes blindly in Britons. Whistler
knew that either he or Ruskin must settle the question whether an
artist may paint what he wants in his own way, though this may not
be understood by the patron, the critic, the Academy, or the real
British judge, the man in the street; whether the artist should rule
or be ruled. The case was, Whistler said, "between the Brush and the
Pen." His motives were ignored, the proceedings made a jest, and the
verdict treated as a farce. Few could, or do, realise that he was in
earnest, that the trial was a defence of his principles, and the verdict
a justification of his belief.</p>

<p>At the time Whistler was to the British public a charlatan, a
mountebank. Ruskin was to the People a preacher, the professor of
art. Whistler denied the right of Ruskin, master of English literature,
populariser of pictures, to declare himself infallible, as he did, his head
turned by his success in defence of the Pre-Raphaelites and booming
of Turner. As to his discoveries, Turner was a full R.A. and Carpaccio
had been accepted for centuries before he "discovered" them.
Ruskin did but popularise Carpaccio, and buy and sell Turner. So
good a friend of Ruskin's as W. M. Rossetti said that he was "substantially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
wrong in the Whistler matter," that his mind broke down at
times, and that his mental troubles began in 1860. His conceit and his
vanity can be explained in no other way. Unfortunately he lived in
the only country where his arrogant pretensions would then have been
countenanced, though, owing to the present acceptance of England
and everything English, he has become something of a fetish abroad,
now that he is exposed and discredited at home. He was rich, he was a
University man, he contributed long letters to the <i>Times</i>. He was a
typical new British patron of the arts, for to him the financial side of
connoisseurship was of the greatest importance&mdash;"two hundred
guineas for flinging a pot of paint." Moreover, he was a master of
English; therefore he could commit any absurdity. As Whistler said,
political economists considered him a great art critic, and artists looked
upon him as a great political economist. Sometimes we have wondered
if there was not another reason for Ruskin's venom. He never appreciated
the great artists of the world, save certain Italians recognised
long before. His estimate of Velasquez and Rembrandt, and
his comparison between Turner and Constable, prove how little his
now unheeded sermons were ever worth. While he failed to comprehend
Charles Keene, he went into ecstasies over Kate Greenaway.
He loved Stacy Marks and hated Snyders. Whistler, knowing this,
may have laughed. Mr. Collingwood wrote that, long before the trial,
Whistler "had made overtures to the great critic through Mr. Swinburne,
the poet; but he had not been taken seriously." It is certain
Ruskin was not taken seriously by the great artist. Swinburne suggested
a meeting in a letter of August 11, 1865, to which we have referred
(published in the <i>Library Edition of the Works of John Ruskin</i>),
but in such words that we gather there must have been some sort of
misunderstanding already between Whistler and Ruskin. Swinburne
wanted to take Ruskin to the studio and represented Whistler as desirous
of meeting him. It is likely that Whistler, knowing Ruskin's
power in the Press, was willing to be written about by him, and also that
Ruskin cherished whatever reason for dislike he had for Whistler.</p>

<p>Anderson Rose prepared the case, and we know the pains and trouble
Whistler took over it. Judge Parry has shown us letters to his father
which prove this. Whistler warned Rose there was no use in making
him out a popular painter; better show the jury that the Academy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and Academicians were against him. He thought, at first, that the
artists would be on his side and would unite with him to drive the false
prophet out of the temple. But Ruskin the critic was to them more
powerful than Whistler the painter, and when the time came they
sneaked away, all except Albert Moore. Besides, there was the hope
that the Yankee would lose. Whistler told us "they hoped they could
drive me out of the country, or kill me! And if I hadn't had the
constitution of a Government mule, they would!"</p>

<p>Charles Keene, whom Whistler considered the greatest English
artist since Hogarth, could write on November 24, 1878:</p>

<p>"Whistler's case against Ruskin comes off, I believe, on Monday.
He wants to subp&oelig;na me as a witness as to whether he is (as Ruskin
says) an impostor or not. I told him I should be glad to record my
opinion, but begged him to do without me if he could. They say it will
most likely be settled on the point of law without going into evidence,
but if the evidence is adduced, it will be the greatest lark that has been
known for a long time in the courts."</p>

<p>Keene did not dare to stand up for Whistler and for art, and the
bitterness is in those last words&mdash;"a lark!"</p>

<p>In the Exchequer Division at Westminster the action for libel,
in which "Mr. James Abbott McNeill Whistler, <i>an</i> artist, seeks to
recover damages against Mr. John Ruskin, <i>the</i> well-known author
and art critic," came up before Baron Huddleston and a special jury.
Our account is compiled chiefly from the reports published in the
<i>Times</i> and the <i>Daily News</i>, November 26 and 27, 1878, from <i>The
Gentle Art</i>, and from what Whistler, Mr. Rossetti, Armstrong, Mr.
Graves, and others who were present have told us. According to
Lady Burne-Jones, Ruskin had been delighted at the prospect of the
trial:</p>

<p>"It's nuts and nectar to me, the notion of having to answer for
myself in court, and the whole thing will enable me to assert some
principles of art economy which I've never got into the public's head
by writing: but may get sent over all the world vividly in a newspaper
report or two. Meanwhile <i>I've</i> heard nothing of the matter yet, and
am only afraid the fellow will be better advised."</p>

<p>Nuts and nectar turned to gall and vinegar. In the early winter
of 1878 rumours of his ill-health reached the papers. Lady Burne-Jones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
adds that, when the action was brought, "although he had
quite recovered from his illness, he was not allowed to appear"&mdash;a
curious sort of recovery. But he was well enough on the morning
of the 26th to write to Charles Eliot Norton that "to-day I believe
the comic Whistler lawsuit is to be decided."</p>

<p>The court was crowded. Mr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Petheram
were counsel for the plaintiff, and the Attorney-General (Sir John
Holker) and Mr. Bowen for the defendant. Mr. Serjeant Parry opened
the case for Whistler, "who has followed the profession of an artist for
many years, while Mr. Ruskin is a gentleman well known to all of us,
and holding perhaps the highest position in Europe or America as an
art critic. Some of his works are destined to immortality, and it is
the more surprising, therefore, that a gentleman holding such a position
could traduce another in a way that would lead that other to
come into a court of law to ask for damages. The jury, after hearing
the case, will come to the conclusion that a great injustice has been
done. Mr. Whistler, in the United States, has earned a reputation
as a painter and an artist. He is not merely a painter, but has likewise
distinguished himself in the capacity of etcher, achieving considerable
honours in that department of art. He has been an unwearied
worker in his profession, always desiring to succeed, and if he had
formed an erroneous opinion, he should not have been treated with
contempt and ridicule. Mr. Ruskin edits a publication called <i>Fors
Clavigera</i>, that has a large circulation among artists and art patrons.
In the July number of 1877 appeared a criticism of the pictures in the
Grosvenor, containing the paragraph which is the defamatory matter
complained of. Sir Coutts Lindsay is described as an amateur, both
in art and shopkeeping, who must take up one business or the other.
Mannerisms and errors are pointed out in the work of Burne-Jones,
but whatever their extent, his pictures 'are never affected or indolent.
The work is natural to the painter, however strange to us, wrought
with the utmost conscience and care, however far, to his or our desire
the result may seem to be incomplete. Scarcely so much can be said
for any other pictures of the modern schools. Their eccentricities
are almost always in some degree forced, and their imperfections
gratuitously, if not impertinently, indulged. For Mr. Whistler's
own sake, no less than for the protection of the purchaser Sir Coutts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Lindsay ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in which
the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approaches the aspect
of wilful imposture. I have seen and heard much of cockney impudence
before now, but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred
guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.' Mr. Ruskin
pleaded that the alleged libel was privileged as being a fair and <i>bona
fide</i> criticism upon a painting which the plaintiff had exposed to public
view. But the terms in which Mr. Ruskin has spoken of the plaintiff
are unfair and ungentlemanly, and are calculated to do, and have done
him, considerable injury, and it will be for the jury to say what damages
the plaintiff is entitled to."</p>

<p>Whistler was the first witness. He said: "I studied in Paris
with Du Maurier, Poynter, Armstrong. I was awarded a gold medal
at The Hague.... My etchings are in the British Museum and
Windsor Castle collections. I exhibited eight pictures at the Grosvenor
Gallery in the summer of 1877. No pictures were exhibited
there save on invitation. I was invited by Sir Coutts Lindsay to
exhibit. The first was a <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold&mdash;The Falling
Rocket</i>. The second, a <i>Nocturne in Blue and Silver</i> [since called <i>Blue
and Gold&mdash;Old Battersea Bridge</i>]. The third, a <i>Nocturne in Blue
and Gold</i>, belonging to the Hon. Mrs. Percy Wyndham. The fourth,
a <i>Nocturne in Blue and Silver</i>, belonging to Mrs. Leyland. The fifth,
an <i>Arrangement in Black&mdash;Irving as Philip II. of Spain</i>. The sixth,
a <i>Harmony in Amber and Black</i>. The seventh, an <i>Arrangement in
Brown</i>. In addition to these, there was a portrait of Mr. Carlyle.
That portrait was painted from sittings Mr. Carlyle gave me. It
has since been engraved, and the artist's proofs were all subscribed
for. The Nocturnes, all but two, were sold before they went to the
Grosvenor Gallery. One of them was sold to the Hon. Percy Wyndham
for two hundred guineas&mdash;the one in <i>Blue and Gold</i>. One I sent to
Mr. Graham in lieu of a former commission, the amount of which
was a hundred and fifty guineas. A third one, <i>Blue and Silver</i>, I
presented to Mrs. Leyland. The one that was for sale was in <i>Black
and Gold&mdash;The Falling Rocket</i>."</p>

<p>Curiously, the only one for sale was pounced on by Ruskin. The
coxcomb was trying to get two hundred guineas, and the British
commercial critic spotted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Asked whether, since the publication of the criticism, he had sold
a Nocturne, Whistler answered: "Not by any means at the same
price as before."</p>

<p>The portraits of Irving and Carlyle were produced in court, and
he is said to have described the <i>Irving</i> as "a large impression&mdash;a sketch;
it was not intended as a finished picture." We do not believe he said
anything of the sort.</p>

<p>He was then asked for his definition of a Nocturne: "I have
perhaps, meant rather to indicate an artistic interest alone in the
work, divesting the picture from any outside sort of interest which
might have been otherwise attached to it. It is an arrangement of
line, form, and colour first, and I make use of any incident of it which
shall bring about a symmetrical result. Among my works are some
night pieces; and I have chosen the word Nocturne because it
generalises and simplifies the whole set of them."</p>

<p><i>The Falling Rocket</i>, though it is difficult here to follow the case,
was evidently produced at this point upside down; Whistler describing
it as a night piece, said it represented the fireworks at
Cremorne.</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Not a view of Cremorne?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "If it were called a view of Cremorne, it would certainly
bring about nothing but disappointment on the part of the beholders.
(Laughter.) It is an artistic arrangement."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Why do you call Mr. Irving an <i>Arrangement in
Black</i>?" (Laughter.)</p>

<p>The judge interposed, though in jest, for there was more laughter,
and explained that the picture, not Mr. Irving, was the <i>Arrangement</i>.</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "All these works are impressions of my own. I make
them my study. I suppose them to appeal to none but those who
may understand the technical matter."</p>

<p>And he added that it would be possible to see the pictures in
Westminster Palace Hotel close by, where he had placed them for
the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "I suppose you are willing to admit that your
pictures exhibit some eccentricities. You have been told that over
and over again?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "Yes, very often." (Laughter.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "You send them to the gallery to invite the
admiration of the public?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "That would be such vast absurdity on my part that
I don't think I could." (Laughter.)</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Can you tell me how long it took you to knock
off that Nocturne?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "I beg your pardon?" (Laughter.)</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "I am afraid that I am using a term that
applies rather perhaps to my own work...."</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: ... "Let us say then, how long did I take to 'knock
off'&mdash;I think that is it&mdash;to knock off that Nocturne; well, as well as
I remember, about a day.... I may have still put a few more touches
to it the next day if the painting were not dry. I had better say,
then, that I was two days at work on it."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "The labour of two days, then, is that for
which you ask two hundred guineas?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "No; I ask it for the knowledge of a lifetime."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "You don't approve of criticism?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "I should not disapprove in any way of technical
criticism by a man whose life is passed in the practice of the science
which he criticises; but for the opinion of a man whose life is not so
passed, I would have as little regard as you would if he expressed an
opinion on law."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "You expect to be criticised?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "Yes, certainly; and I do not expect to be affected
by it until it comes to be a case of this kind."</p>

<p>The Nocturne, the <i>Blue and Silver</i>, was then produced.</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "It represents Battersea Bridge by moonlight."</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i>: "Is this part of the picture at the top Old Battersea
Bridge? Are those figures on the top of the bridge intended for
people?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "They are just what you like."</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i>: "That is a barge beneath?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "Yes, I am very much flattered at your seeing that.
The picture is simply a representation of moonlight. My whole
scheme was only to bring about a certain harmony of colour."</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i>: "How long did it take you to paint that picture?"</p>

<p>"How long did it take you to paint that?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "One whole day and part of another."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "What is the peculiar beauty of that
picture?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "It would be impossible for me to explain to you,
I am afraid, although I dare say I could to a sympathetic ear."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Do you not think that anybody looking at the
picture might fairly come to the conclusion that it had no particular
beauty?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "I have strong evidence that Mr. Ruskin did come to
that conclusion."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Do you think it fair that Mr. Ruskin should
come to that conclusion?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "What might be fair to Mr. Ruskin, I cannot answer.
No artist of culture would come to that conclusion."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Do you offer that picture to the public as
one of particular beauty, fairly worth two hundred guineas?"</p>

<p><i>Whistler</i>: "I offer it as a work that I have conscientiously executed
and that I think worth the money. I would hold my reputation upon
this, as I would upon any of my other works."</p>

<p>Mr. W. M. Rossetti was the next witness. He was Ruskin's friend
as well as Whistler's, and the position was not pleasant. But, he has
written us, he was "compelled to act, willy-nilly, in opposition to
Ruskin's interest in the action."</p>

<p><i>Rossetti</i>: "I consider the <i>Blue and Silver</i> an artistic and beautiful</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>representation of a pale but bright moonlight. I admire Mr. Whistler's
pictures, but not without exception. I appreciate the meaning of the
titles. The <i>Falling Rocket</i> is not one of the pictures I admire."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Is it a gem?" (Laughter.)</p>

<p><i>Rossetti</i>: "No."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Is it an exquisite painting?"</p>

<p><i>Rossetti</i>: "No."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Is it very beautiful?"</p>

<p><i>Rossetti</i>: "No."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Is it a work of art?"</p>

<p><i>Rossetti</i>: "Yes, it is."</p>

<p><i>Attorney-General</i>: "Is it worth two hundred guineas?"</p>

<p><i>Rossetti</i>: "Yes."</p>

<p>Albert Moore said that Whistler's pictures were beautiful, and
that no other painter could have succeeded in doing them. The
<i>Black and Gold</i> he looked upon as simply marvellous, the most consummate
art. Asked if there was eccentricity in the picture, he said
he should call it originality.</p>

<p>W. G. Wills testified to the knowledge shown in the pictures; they
were the works of a man of genius.</p>

<p>Mr. Algernon Graves was in court to give evidence to the popularity
of the <i>Carlyle</i>. As the picture was not catalogued when exhibited at
the Grosvenor, Baron Huddleston ruled that there was no proof of
its having been exhibited in 1877, and he was not called. These
were the only witnesses for Whistler, though we have seen a letter
he wrote to Anderson Rose suggesting Haweis, who had preached
"a poem of praise" about The Peacock Room, and Prince Teck, who
might be asked to swear that he "thought it a great piece of art." We
have also seen the draft of a letter to Tissot upon whose aid he relied.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General submitted there was no case. But Baron
Huddleston could not deny that the criticism held Whistler's work
up to ridicule and contempt; that so far it was libellous, and must,
therefore, go to the jury. It was for the Attorney-General to prove
it fair and honest criticism.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General's address to the jury began with praise of
Ruskin, it went on with ridicule of the testimony for the plaintiff, it
finished with contempt for Whistler and his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Nocturnes were not worthy the name of great works of art.
He had that morning looked into the dictionary for the meaning of
coxcomb, and found that the word carried the old idea of the licensed
jester who had a cap on his head with a cock's comb in it. If that were
the true definition, Mr. Whistler should not complain, because his
pictures were capital jests which had afforded much amusement to the
public. He said, without fear of contradiction, that if Mr. Whistler
founded his reputation on the pictures he had shown in the Grosvenor
Gallery, the <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold</i>, the <i>Nocturne in Blue and
Silver</i>, his <i>Arrangement of Irving in Black</i>, his representation of the
<i>Ladies in Brown</i>, and his <i>Symphonies in Grey and Yellow</i>, he was a mere
pretender to the art of painting."</p>

<p>In Ruskin's absence, Burne-Jones was the first witness called for
the defence. Lady Burne-Jones says, in her <i>Memorials of Edward
Burne-Jones</i>, that on November 2, Ruskin had written to him:</p>

<p>"I gave your name to the blessed lawyer, as chief of men to whom
they might refer for anything which, in their wisdom, they can't
discern unaided concerning me."</p>

<p>She adds that for her husband: "Few positions could have been
more annoying or difficult for the paragraph containing the sentence
in question&mdash;one of Ruskin's severest condemnations&mdash;was practically
a comparison between Mr. Whistler's work and Edward's own. But
the subject covered so much wider ground than any personality that
Edward was finally able to put this thought aside, and did with calmness
what he had undertaken to do, namely&mdash;endorse Ruskin's criticism that
good workmanship was essential to a good picture."</p>

<p>Walter Crane stated in his <i>Reminiscences</i> that he met Burne-Jones
at dinner at Leyland's not long before the trial; and that then
Burne-Jones would not see Whistler's merit as an artist. "He seemed
to think there was only one <i>right</i> way of painting.... Under the
circumstances he could hardly afford to allow any credit to Whistler."</p>

<p>In court Burne-Jones temporised. He admitted Whistler's art,
but regretted the want of finish in Whistler's pictures; so strengthening
the impression of the laziness, levity, or looseness of Whistler.
In his "deliberate judgment" Mrs. Leyland's <i>Blue and Silver</i> was
a work of art, but a very incomplete one. "It did not show the
finish of a complete work of art," yet "it is masterly. Neither in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
composition, detail, nor form has the picture any quality whatever,
but in colour it has a very fine quality.... <i>Blue and Silver&mdash;Old,
Battersea Bridge</i>, in colour is even better than the other. It is more
formless, it is bewildering in form. As to composition and detail,
there is none whatever. It has no finish. I do not think Mr. Whistler
intended it to be regarded as a finished picture."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bowen</i>: "Now, take the <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold&mdash;The
Falling Rocket</i>, is that, in your opinion, a work of art?"</p>

<p><i>Burne-Jones</i>: "No, I cannot say that it is. It is only one of a
thousand failures that artists have made in their efforts to paint
night."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bowen</i>: "Is that picture in your judgment worth two hundred
guineas?"</p>

<p><i>Burne-Jones</i>: "No, I cannot say it is, seeing how much careful
work men do for much less. Mr. Whistler gave infinite promise at
first, but I do not think he has fulfilled it. I think he has evaded
the great difficulty of painting, and has not tested his powers by carrying
it out. The difficulties in painting increase daily as the work progresses,
and that is the reason why so many of us fail. We are none
of us perfect. The danger is this, that if unfinished pictures become
common, we shall arrive at a stage of mere manufacture and the art
of the country will be degraded."</p>

<p>Mr. Frith, R.A., was next called. Truly, Ruskin found himself
with strange supporters. Frith was chosen, we have been told, because
Ruskin wanted some one who could not be thought biased in his favour.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bowen</i>: "Are the pictures works of art?"</p>

<p><i>Frith</i>: "I should say not."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bowen</i>: "Is the <i>Nocturne in Blue and Gold</i> a serious work
of art?"</p>

<p><i>Frith</i>: "Not to me. It is not worth, in my opinion, two hundred
guineas. <i>Old Battersea Bridge</i> does not convey the impression of
moonlight to me in the slightest degree. The colour does not represent
any more than you could get from a bit of wallpaper or silk."</p>

<p>In cross-examination he contradicted himself, and said that he
thought Mr. Whistler had "very great power as an artist."</p>

<p>Ruskin's final supporter was Tom Taylor, critic of the <i>Times</i>.
No, he said, the <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold</i> was not a good picture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and, to prove it, he read his own criticism in the <i>Times</i>, and his assertion
there that the Nocturnes were worth doing because they were the only
things that Whistler could do.</p>

<p>A portrait by Titian was then shown, in order to explain Burne-Jones'
idea of finish, and the jury, mistaking it for a Whistler, would
have none of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowen, in summing up the case, said that all that Ruskin
had done was to express an opinion on Whistler's pictures&mdash;an opinion
to which he adhered. This was about all he could say except, in
conclusion, to appeal to the jury. There was no defence. Mr. Serjeant
Parry, in his reply, pointed out that they had not dared to ask if
Whistler deserved to be stigmatised as a wilful impostor, and that even
if Ruskin had not been well enough to attend the court "he might
have been examined before a commission. His decree has gone forth
that Whistler's pictures were worthless. He has not supported
that by evidence. He has not condescended to give reasons for the
view he has taken, he has treated us with contempt, as he treated
Whistler. He has said: 'I, Mr. Ruskin, seated on my throne of
art, say what I please and expect all the world to agree with me.'
Mr. Ruskin is a great writer, but not as a man; as a man he has
degraded himself. His tone in writing the article is personal and
malicious. Mr. Ruskin's criticism of Mr. Whistler's pictures is almost
exclusively in the nature of a personal attack, a pretended criticism
of art which is really a criticism upon the man himself, and calculated
to injure him. It was written recklessly, and for the purpose of holding
him up to ridicule and contempt. Mr. Ruskin has gone out of his
way to attack Mr. Whistler personally, and must answer for the consequences
of having written a damnatory attack upon the painter.
This is what is called pungent criticism, stinging criticism, but it
is defamatory, and I hope the jury will mark their disapproval by
their verdict."</p>

<p>The Judge pointed out that"there are certain words by Mr. Ruskin,
about which I should think no one would entertain a doubt: those
words amount to a libel. The critic should confine himself to criticism
and not make it a veil for personal censure or for showing his power.
The question for the jury is, did Mr. Whistler's ideas of art justify the
language used by Mr. Ruskin? And the further question is whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the insult offered&mdash;if insult there has been&mdash;is of such a gross character
as to call for substantial damages? Whether it is a case for merely
contemptuous damages to the extent of a farthing, or something of
that sort, indicating that it is one which ought never to have been
brought into court, and in which no pecuniary damage has been
sustained; or whether the case is one which calls for damages in some
small sum as indicating the opinion of the jury that the offender has
gone beyond the strict letter of the law."</p>

<p>After an hour's deliberation, the jury gave their verdict for the
plaintiff&mdash;damages one farthing. The Judge emphasised his contempt
by giving judgment for Whistler without costs; that is, both sides
had to pay.</p>

<p>It is said that Whistler wore the farthing on his watch-chain. We
never saw it, we never knew him to wear a watch-chain. But he
made a drawing of the farthing for <i>The Gentle Art</i>.</p>

<p>"The whole thing was a hateful affair," Burne-Jones wrote to
Rossetti, and many agreed with him, though for other reasons. The
<i>Times</i>, the <i>Spectator</i>, and the <i>Portfolio</i> pronounced the verdict satisfactory
to neither party, virtually a censure upon both. Mr. Graves,
who watched the trial without the responsibility he was disposed to
meet, says:</p>

<p>"I have always felt that, had the plaintiff's counsel impressed upon
the jury that Mr. Ruskin had mentioned the price asked for the picture,
a matter that has always been outside the critic's province, as well
as criticising them as works of art, the result to Mr. Whistler would
have been more in his favour. Mr. Tom Taylor was never asked
whether he had ever criticised the price as well as the quality."</p>

<p>Armstrong has told us of the suppression of important letters:
"A little while before the trial I met Whistler one evening at the
Arts Club, and he told me of his hopes of a favourable result. My
sympathies were entirely on his side. He assured me that he
had evidence, which I believe could not fail to be effective, in the shape
of letters from Leighton, P.R.A.; Burton, Director of the National
Gallery; and Poynter, R.A., then Director for Art at S.K., speaking
highly of the moonlight pictures. These letters seemed to me most
important, for they were from people in official positions, whose good
words would have weighed with the British jurymen. Nothing was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
said about these letters in the newspaper reports, and I asked Jimmie
the reason for this omission of the strongest evidence on his side.
He told me that the writers of the letters had objected to their being
put in, and so he had refrained from using them, and without the
personal testimony of the writers they would not have been accepted
as evidence in court. After the trial I saw Holker and asked him if he
had been helping to smirch any more poor artists. He replied that he
was bound to do the best he could for his client. I told him he would
never have allowed the exhibition of the pictures in court if he had
been Whistler's counsel, and he asked: 'Why didn't Jimmie have me?'
I explained that I had recommended his being retained, but it was
objected that his fee would be too heavy, and he said, 'I'd have done
it for nothing for Jimmie.' I was very sorry that Mr. Ruskin was not
punished."</p>

<p>Arthur Severn wrote us that, at the Ruskin trial, he "was on the
opposite side, although my sympathies were rather with Whistler,
whose <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold</i> I knew to be carefully painted.
Whenever we met he was most courteous, understanding my position.
During the trial one of the Nocturnes were handed across the court
over the people's heads, so that Whistler might verify it as his work.
On its way, an old gentleman with a bald head got a tap from the
frame, then the picture showed signs of falling out of its frame, and
when Serjeant Parry turned to Whistler and said 'Is that your work,
Mr. Whistler?' the artist, putting his eye-glass up and with his slight
American twang, said, 'Well, it was, but if it goes on much longer
in that way, I don't think it will be.' And when Ruskin's Titian was
shown, 'Oh, come, we've had enough of those Whistlers,' said a juryman.
I thought Whistler looked anxious whilst the jury was away.
Another trial came on so as not to waste time. The court was dark,
and candles had to be brought in&mdash;it seemed to be about some rope,
and huge coils were on the solicitors' table. A stupid clerk was being
examined. Nothing intelligent could be got out of him, and at last
Mr. Day, one of the counsel (afterwards the judge), said, 'Give him the
rope's end,' which produced great laughter in court, in which Whistler
heartily joined. Then, suddenly, a hush fell; the jury returned a
verdict for Whistler, damages one farthing."</p>

<p>There was a report of an application for a new trial. A desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
was expressed that friends of artist and critic might adjust the dispute.
But Whistler made no application, called for no arbitration. He
accepted his farthing damages. The British public rallied to their
prophet, and got up a subscription for the rich man. It was managed
by the Fine Art Society. The account was opened at the Union
Bank of London in the names of Burne-Jones, F. S. Ellis, and Mr.
Marcus B. Huish, and by December 10 a subscription list was published,
amounting already to one hundred and fifty-one pounds, five shillings
and sixpence, headed by Burne-Jones, five guineas. The costs were
estimated at three hundred and eighty-five pounds, and Mr. E. T. Cook
says that eventually they were paid by his friends.</p>

<p>According to W. M. Rossetti, "Whistler wrote to Anderson Rose,
saying it would be at least equally appropriate for a band of subscribers
to pay his costs; and, he added, 'And in the event of a subscription
I would willingly contribute my own mite.'"</p>

<p>Mr. J. P. Heseltine started a fund for Whistler, and a list was opened
at the office of <i>L'Art</i>, 134 New Bond Street. But nothing came of it,
except that Whistler sent one of his pastels to Mr. Heseltine. For
Whistler, the poor man, the costs were not paid, and he went through
the bankruptcy court.</p>

<p>Letters flowed into the papers. There were interviews. Witticisms
went the rounds. Whistler is reported to have said, "Well, you know,
I don't go so far as to Burne-Jones, but really somebody ought to burn
Jones' pictures!" A few journalists did not forget that Whistler
was an artist, a few people were sympathetic, a few congratulations
were received at the White House. If Whistler was disappointed he
kept it to himself. He would have liked better to get his costs and
damages, he said. But the verdict was a moral triumph. He had
gone into court not for damages but to vindicate his position, and,
therefore, that of artists.</p>

<p>Whistler explained this position in <i>Whistler</i> v. <i>Ruskin&mdash;Art and
Art Critics</i> (December 1878), the first of his series of pamphlets in
brown-paper covers. It was printed by Spottiswoode, though his
idea was to have it lithographed by Way, and published by Chatto
and Windus. He dedicated it to Albert Moore. It is a protest
against the folly of the Pen in venturing to criticise the Brush. Literature
is left to the literary man, science to the scientist, why then
should art be at the mercy of "the one who was never in it," but whose
boast it is that he is doing good to art. The critics "are all 'doing
good'&mdash;yes, they all do good to Art. Poor Art! what a sad state
the slut is in, and these gentlemen shall help her." Ruskin resigned
the Slade Professorship. He wrote to Dean Liddell from Brantwood
(November 28, 1878) that the result of the Whistler trial left him no
option. "I cannot hold a chair from which I have no power of expressing
judgment without being taxed for it by British Law." Unless
he continued to be the Pope and the Prophet he believed himself,
he could not go on. He could not stand criticism, and he collapsed
when his criticism was questioned. The trial, he wrote, made his
professorship a farce. Whistler suggested that Ruskin might fill a
Chair of Ethics instead. "<i>Il faut vivre</i>," was the cry of the art critic
but Whistler said, "<i>Je n'en vois pas la nécessité</i>."</p>

<p>Whistler won. The trial was a triumph. But he had to pay
heavily for his victory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX: BANKRUPTCY.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-EIGHT AND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-NINE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler's</span> financial affairs were in hopeless confusion. The builder's
estimate for the White House was largely exceeded, the cost of the trial
had to be paid for, the <i>atelier</i> waited for pupils, and the debts brought
from Lindsey Row were many. He wrote to his mother at Hastings of
his economies and his hopes to pay his debts, but he did not know the
meaning of economy. There is a legend of a grocer who had let a
bill for tomatoes and fruit run up to six hundred pounds, and when,
after the trial, he insisted on settlement, Whistler said:</p>

<p>"How&mdash;what&mdash;why&mdash;why, of course, you have sent these things&mdash;most
excellent things&mdash;and they have been eaten, you know, by most
excellent people. Think what a splendid advertisement. And sometimes,
you know, the tomatoes are not quite up to the mark, the fruit,
you know, not quite fresh. And if you go into these unseemly
discussions about the bill&mdash;well, you know, I shall have to go into discussions
about all this&mdash;and think how it would hurt your reputation
with all these extraordinary people. I think the best thing is not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
refer to the past&mdash;I'll let it go, and in the future we'll have a weekly
account&mdash;wiser, you know."</p>

<p>The grocer left without his money, but was offered in payment
two Nocturnes, one the upright Valparaiso. Another story of the
same grocer is that he arrived with his account as a grand piano was
being carried in. Whistler said he was so busy he couldn't attend to
the matter just then, and the grocer thought if grand pianos were being
bought, it must be all right. To a dealer in rugs Whistler would have
given three Nocturnes in payment, but the dealer refused and spent
the rest of his life regretting it.</p>

<p>It was nothing unusual for bailiffs to be in possession, or for bills
to cover the walls. The first time this happened, Whistler said to
the people whom he invited to dine that they might know his house
by the bills on it. When someone complained that creditors kept him
walking up and down all night, Whistler was amused:</p>

<p>"Dear me! Do as I do! Leave the walking up and down to the
creditors!"</p>

<p>Of the bailiffs he made a new feature at his breakfasts. Mrs.
Lynedoch Moncrieff has told us of a Sunday when two or three men
waited with Whistler's servant, John, and she said to Whistler:</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you've grown so wealthy."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Bailiffs! You know, I had to put them to some use!"</p>

<p>Mr. Rossetti and his wife once found the same "liveried attendants."</p>

<p>"'Your servants seem to be extremely attentive, Mr. Whistler,
and anxious to please you,' one of the guests said. 'Oh yes,' was his
answer, 'I assure you they wouldn't leave me.'"</p>

<p>Others remember a Sunday when the furniture was numbered
for a sale. When breakfast was announced by a bailiff, Whistler said:
"They are wonderful fellows. You will see how excellently they wait
at table, and to-morrow, you know, if you want, you can see them sell
the chairs you sit on every bit as well. Amazing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Edwin Edwards wrote us that when three men were in possession,
he treated them while his friends carted away his pictures out of
the back door. Others say that the bailiffs, multiplied to seven, were
invited into the garden, and given beer with a little something in it.
No sooner had they tasted than down went their heads on the table
round which they sat. People dining with Whistler that evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
were taken into the garden to see the seven sleepers of Ephesus: "Stick
pins in them, shout in their ears&mdash;see&mdash;you can't wake them!" All
evening it rained and it rained, and it thundered, and it lightened,
and it hailed. All night they slept. Morning came and they slept.
But at the hour when he had given them their glass the day before,
they all woke up and asked for more.</p>

<p>One of the bailiffs at the end of a week, demanded his money.
Whistler said:</p>

<p>"If I could afford to keep you I would do without you."</p>

<p>"But what is to become of my wife and family if I don't get my
wages, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ha ha! You must ask those who sent you here to answer that
question."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Whistler, sir, I need the money."</p>

<p>"Oh ho! Have a man in yourself."</p>

<p>Whistler said "it was kind of them to see to such tedious affairs."
One he asked: "And how long will you be 'the man in possession?'"</p>

<p>"That, Mr. Whistler, sir, depends on your paying Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s bill.</p>

<p>"Awkward for me, but perhaps more for you! I hope you won't
mind it, though, you know, I fear your stay with me will be a lengthy
one. However, you will find it not entirely unprofitable, for you will
see and hear much that may be useful to you."</p>

<p>When things got more desperate, bills covered the front of the house,
announcing the sale. Whistler, begging the bailiffs to be at home,
went one night to dine. It was stormy, and, returning late, he found
that the rain had washed the bills loose and they were flapping in
the wind. He woke up the bailiffs, made them get a ladder, and
paste every bill down again. He had allowed them to cover his house
with their posters, but, so long as he lived in it, no man should sleep
with it in a slovenly condition.</p>

<p>Early in May 1879, Whistler was declared bankrupt. His liabilities
were four thousand six hundred and forty-one pounds, nine shillings
and three pence, and his assets, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four
pounds, nine shillings and four pence. In his long overcoat,
longer than ever, swinging his cane lengthening in defiance, his hat
set jauntily on his curls, he appeared in the City:</p>

<p>"Ha ha! Well, you know, here I am in the City! Amazing!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
You know, on the way, I dropped in to see George Lewis, being in
the neighbourhood, and, you know, ha ha, he gave me a paper for you
to sign!"</p>

<p>It was a petition in bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The creditors met at the Inns of Court Hotel in June. Sir Thomas
Sutherland was in the chair, and Leyland, the chief creditor, and various
Chelsea tradesmen attended. The only novelty in the proceedings
was a speech by Whistler on plutocrats, men with millions, and what
he thought of them, and it was with difficulty he was called to order.
A committee of examiners was appointed, composed of Leyland, Howell,
and Thomas Way.</p>

<p>Leyland was not let off by Whistler. As Michael Angelo, painting
the walls of the Sistine Chapel, plunged the critic who had offended
him into hell, so Whistler immortalised the man by whom he thought
himself wronged. He painted three pictures. The first was <i>The
Loves of the Lobsters&mdash;an Arrangement in Rats</i>, the most prominent
lobster in the shirt-frills of Leyland. "Whom the gods wish to make
ridiculous, they furnish with a frill!" he said, and the saying was
repeated until it reached Leyland, as he meant it should. The second
was <i>Mount Ararat</i>, Noah's Ark on a hill, with little figures all in frills.
The third was the <i>Gold Scab&mdash;Eruption in Frilthy Lucre</i>, a creature,
breaking out in scabs of golden sovereigns, wearing the frill, seated
on the White House playing the piano. The hideousness of the figure
is more appalling because of the colour, the design. A malicious joke
begun in anger, Mr. Arthur Symons has described it, from which
"beauty exudes like the scent of a poisonous flower." Years after,
when it was exhibited at the Goupil Gallery, one of the serious new
critics regretted that Whistler allowed himself to be influenced by
Beardsley. These caricatures alone were in the studio when Leyland
and the committee made the inventory. Augustus Hare wrote (May 13,
1879) of a visit in the meantime:</p>

<p>"This morning I went with a very large party to Whistler's studio.
We were invited to see the pictures, but there was only one there, <i>The
Loves of the Lobsters</i>. It was supposed to represent Niagara, and
looked as if the artist had upset the inkstand, and left Providence to
work out its own results. In the midst of the black chaos were two
lobsters curveting opposite each other, and looking as if they were done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
with red sealing-wax. 'I wonder you did not paint the lobsters
making love before they were boiled,' aptly observed a lady visitor.
'Oh, I never thought of that,' said Whistler. It was a joke, I suppose.
The little man, with his plume of white hair ('the Whistler tuft' he
calls it) waving on his forehead, frisked about the room, looking most
strange and uncanny, and rather diverted himself over our disappointment
in coming so far and finding nothing to see. People admire
like sheep his pictures in the Grosvenor Gallery, following each other's
lead because it is the fashion."</p>

<p>Worried as he was, Whistler sent to the Grosvenor of 1879 the
<i>Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder</i>, <i>Portrait of Miss Connie Gilchrist</i>,
<i>The Pacific</i>, <i>Nocturne in Blue and Gold</i>, six etchings, two studies
in chalk, and three pastels. His etching, <i>Old Putney Bridge</i>,
was at the Royal Academy. The critics talked the usual nonsense,
and have since repented it. Mr. (now Sir) Frederick Wedmore distinguished
himself by an article: <i>Mr. Whistler's Theories and Mr.
Whistler's Art</i>, in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (August 1879), and afterwards
reprinted in <i>Four Masters of Etching</i> (1883). He could appreciate
Whistler's work as little as he could understand <i>Art and Art
Critics</i>, and from its wit was&mdash;and is&mdash;still smarting. Whistler he
placed as:</p>

<p>"Long ago an artist of high promise. Now he is an artist often of
agreeable, though sometimes of incomplete and seemingly wayward
performance.... That only the artist should write on art by continued
reiteration may convince the middle-class public that has little
of the instinct of art. But, sirs, not so easily can you dispense with
the services of Diderot and Ruskin."</p>

<p>Wedmore had apparently never heard of Cennini and Dürer,
Vasari and Cellini, Da Vinci and Reynolds and Fromentin, who
remain, while Diderot and Ruskin and Wedmore himself are discredited
or forgotten. He regretted that Whistler's "painted work
is somewhat apt to be dependent on the innocent error that confuses
the beginning with the end." He condemned the <i>Portrait of Henry
Irving</i> as a "murky caricature of Velasquez," the <i>Carlyle</i> as "a doleful
canvas." The Nocturnes were "encouraging sketches," with "an
effect of harmonious decoration, so that a dozen or so of them on the
upper panels of a lofty chamber would afford even to the wallpapers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of William Morris a welcome and justifiable alternative.... They
suffer cruelly when placed against work not, of course, of petty and
mechanical finish, but of patient achievement. But they have a
merit of their own, and I do not wish to understate it."</p>

<p>Whistler had "never mastered the subtleties of accurate form";
"the interest of life&mdash;the interest of humanity" had little occupied
him, <i>but</i> Wedmore hoped that the career, begun with promise, "might
not close in work too obstinately faithful to eccentric error." By his
etchings his name might "aspire to live," though, "for his fame, Mr.
Whistler has etched too much, or at least has published too much,"
though there is "commonness and vulgarity" in the figures in many
prints, though he "lacked the art, the patience, or the will to continue"
others.</p>

<p>"The future will forget his disastrous failures, to which in the
present has somehow been accorded, through the activity of friendship,
or the activity of enmity, a publicity rarely bestowed upon failures
at all."</p>

<p>In the same month and year, August 1879, an American, Mr. W. C.
Brownell, published in <i>Scribner's Monthly</i> an article on <i>Whistler in
Painting and Etching</i>. He treated Whistler and his work with a seriousness
in "significant" contrast to Wedmore's clumsy flippancy. This
was the first intelligent American article in Whistler's support, and it
was illustrated by wood-engravings of his paintings and prints. Amidst
the torrent of abuse, it came when Whistler most needed it. But it
was not taken seriously, and much was made of Mr. Brownell's slip in
describing the dry-point <i>Jo</i> as a portrait of Whistler's brother.</p>

<p>Whistler, left homeless by his bankruptcy, revived the plan for the
journey to Venice, and a series of etchings there. He suggested it to
Ernest G. Brown, Messrs. Seeley's representative when the <i>Billingsgate</i>
was published in the <i>Portfolio</i>, and now with the Fine Art Society
who, at his persuasion, had brought out four of the London plates
this year: <i>Free-Trade Wharf</i>, <i>Old Battersea Bridge</i>, <i>Old Putney Bridge</i>,
and <i>The Little Putney, No. 1</i>. They liked the new scheme so well
that they gave Whistler a commission for twelve plates in Venice to
be delivered in three months' time. One hundred proofs of each were
to be printed, and he was to receive, we believe, twelve hundred pounds.</p>

<p>By September 7 (1879), Whistler apparently in great spirits, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"everything was to be sold up," was "arranging his route to Venice"
says Mr. Cole. From the receiver he had permission to destroy
unfinished work. Copperplates were scratched and pictures smeared
with glue, stripped off their stretchers and rolled up. Then he packed
his trunk, wrote over his front door: "Except the Lord build the
house, they labour in vain that build it. E. W. Godwin, F.S.A.,
built this one," and started for Venice.</p>

<p>The White House was sold on September 18, 1879, to Mr. Harry
Quilter, who paid for it two thousand seven hundred pounds in money
at the time, and later in Whistler's jeers. The public laughed at the
furniture and effects, "at which even a broker's man would turn up
his nose. If ever the seamy side of a fashionable artist's existence
was shown, it was during that auction in Chelsea.... Truly, if
Ruskin had wished to have his revenge, he might have enjoyed it
at the White House, when his prosecutor's specially built-to-order
abode was characterised as a disgrace to the neighbourhood by Philistinic
spectators, and its contents supplied material for the rude jokes
of Hebrew brokers and the special correspondent of the <i>Echo</i>."</p>

<p>"Two wooden spoons, a rusty knife handle and two empty oil
tins," was one of the lots. Rolls of canvases were carried off for a
few shillings. Out of them came a <i>Valparaiso</i>, a <i>Cremorne Gardens</i>,
the portrait of Sir Henry Cole, a <i>White Girl</i> and a <i>Blue Girl</i>, the portrait
of Miss Florence Leyland, in such a condition that nothing now remains
but the two blue pots of flowers on either side. The <i>Cremorne Gardens</i>,
a few years after Whistler's death, was sold by T. R. Way for twelve
hundred pounds to Mr. A. H. Hannay. Then an effort was made to
sell it, through London dealers, for almost four times the price to the
Melbourne Gallery, where there were no Whistlers and where, therefore,
those who had Whistler's interests at heart thought it would not
represent him worthily. Later on the painting was sold to the Metropolitan
Museum, New York. It was first cleaned by T. R. Way, and
when we saw it and had it photographed for the earlier edition of this
book, it contained portraits of both Leyland and Whistler. It has
since been cleaned again and the portraits have completely disappeared.
Whether the Metropolitan is responsible for the vandalism we do not
know. But we do know that it is this way history is wiped from the
face of the earth by the restorer. Thomas Way, at the sale, bought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<i>The Lobsters</i> and <i>Mount Ararat</i>. Other pictures went astray or disappeared
temporarily, for a few intelligent people were at the sale.
Whistler wrote to Mrs. William Whistler from Venice begging her to
trace and find them, which she was unable to do. But they are turning
up now.</p>

<p>Whistler's china, prints, and a few pictures were reserved for a sale
at Sotheby's, on Thursday, February 12, 1880. The title-page of the
catalogue is: "<i>In Liquidation. By order of the Trustees of J. A.
McN. Whistler. Catalogue of the Decorative Porcelain, Cabinets,
Paintings and other Works of Art of J. A. McN. Whistler. Received
from the White House, Fulham, comprising Numerous Pieces of Blue and
White China; the Painting in Oil of</i> Connie Gilchrist, Dancing with a
Skipping-Rope, <i>styled</i> A Girl in Gold, <i>by Whistler; A Satirical
painting of a Gentleman, styled</i> The Creditor, <i>by Whistler. Crayon
Drawings and Etchings, Cabinets, and Miscellaneous Articles</i>." When
Leyland learned that the <i>Gold Scab&mdash;The Creditor</i>, was in the sale he
did his best to have it removed. Dealers and amateurs were there:
Way, Oscar Wilde, Huish, The Fine Art Society, Dowdeswell, Lord
Redesdale, Deschamps, Wickham Flower, and Howell were purchasers.
Howell secured the Japanese screen, the background of the <i>Princesse du
Pays de la Porcelaine</i>. The Japanese bath fell to Mr. Jarvis. <i>The
Creditor</i> was bought by Messrs. Dowdeswell for twelve guineas, vanished,
turned up in the King's Road, Chelsea, years later, and was purchased
by Mr. G. P. Jacomb-Hood for ten pounds, and is now in the collection
of Mrs. Spreckles in San Francisco. It is one of the documents Mr.
Freer should have&mdash;and could have had&mdash;as he should have the
<i>Whistler</i> with the brushes, the <i>Mrs. Leyland</i>, the <i>Dr. Whistler</i>, and
others which would add enormously to the historic value as well as
artistic completeness of his collection. <i>Connie Gilchrist</i> was sold to
Mr. Wilkinson for fifty guineas. Whistler's bust by Boehm was bought
by Way for six guineas. A crayon sketch, catalogued as a portrait
of Sarah Bernhardt, was knocked down for five guineas to Oscar Wilde,
who asked her to sign it, which she did, writing that it was very like her.
It might have been handed down as her portrait, had it not appeared
at Oscar Wilde's sale, and found its way back to Whistler, who declared
that Madame Bernhardt never sat to him. The sale at Sotheby's
realised three hundred and twenty-eight pounds, nineteen shillings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI: VENICE.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
SEVENTY-NINE AND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> years Whistler wanted to go to Venice. When he got there he
found it a difficult place to work in. It was cold, and he felt the cold.
It is almost impossible to hold a copper-plate or a needle with numbed
fingers, and Venice in ice made him long for London in fog. He would
gladly have exchanged the Square of St. Mark's for Piccadilly, a gondola
for a hansom. Even Ruskin says this.</p>

<p>Affairs in London worried him. He wrote for news of the vanished
pictures. He knew that his letters had got into second-hand bookshops&mdash;even
letters to his mother. He was ill and the Doctor was far away.</p>

<p>Venice he thought beautiful, most beautiful after rain when, he
wrote his mother, the colour and reflections were gorgeous. The
Venetian masters interested him. At the Scuola di San Rocco he is
remembered climbing up for a closer look at the Tintorettos. Veronese
and Titian were great swells; Canaletto and Guardi, great masters.
He went to St. Mark's for Mass at Christmas, though he wrote that the
ceiling of The Peacock Room was more splendid than the dome. But,
as he told Fantin years before, it was a waste of time to search for
new subjects, and all subjects were new to him in Venice. Countess
Rucellai (Miss Edith Bronson) writes that "he used to say Venice was an
impossible place to sit down and sketch, 'there was something still
better round the corner.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Woods says: "He wandered for motives, but no matter
how much he wandered, and appeared to loaf, when he found a subject
he worked with a determination that no cold and cheerlessness could
daunt. I remember his energy&mdash;and suffering&mdash;when doing those
beautiful pastels, nearly all done during the coldest winter I have
known in Venice, and mostly towards evening when the cold was
bitterest! He soon found out the beautiful quality of colour there is
here before sunset in winter. He had a strong constitution. He was
only unwell once with a bad cold."</p>

<p>The Fine Art Society asked him to make twelve plates in three
months. The plates were not started for weeks, and the Fine Art
Society demanded what he was doing. The answer was at first silence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and then a request for more money. The Fine Art Society began to
doubt and Whistler was furious. Then reports came that he was doing
enormous plates they had not ordered. Howell and others said that
Whistler would never come back, and Academicians laughed at the
idea of the Society getting either plates or their money from such a
"charlatan." With each new suggestion of doubt, Whistler's fury grew.
"Amazing their letters and mine, but, perhaps, not for the public."
The delay was his care. Even Frank Duveneck, most procrastinating
of mortals, made his Venetian etchings, and Otto Bacher changed his
style and did his Venetian plates, before Whistler found his subjects.</p>

<p>It amused him to tell the American Consul that idleness is the virtue
of the artist, but it was a virtue he denied himself. It was "the same
old story" he wrote his mother, "I am at my work the first thing
at dawn and the last thing at night." He could not stand the Venetian
crowd, and he worked as much as possible out of windows. He did
little from gondola or sandolo. To the tourist, a gondola is a thing of
joy; to the worker, it is a terrible, unstable studio, and even in the old
days it cost a hundred francs a month, but then, the gondolier was
your slave.</p>

<p>He mostly left the monuments of Venice, as of London, alone. In
London he preferred Battersea and Wapping to Westminster and St.
Paul's; in Venice little canals and <i>calli</i>, doorways and gardens, beggars
and bridges made a stronger appeal to him than churches and palaces.
He deliberately avoided the motives of Guardi and Canaletto. To
reproduce the masterpieces of the masters is, he said, an impertinence,
and he found for himself "a Venice in Venice."</p>

<p>Whistler, Mr. Howard Walker tells us, took a room in the Palazzo
Rezzonico, where he would paint the sunset and then swear at the
sun for setting. We know of no work done from the palace, though
<i>The Palaces</i> which he etched are on the opposite side of the Grand
Canal. Mr. Ross Turner remembers that he found Whistler in a small
house with a small garden in front near the Frari, no doubt "the
quarters" of which Otto Bacher speaks, and Mr. Turner remembers,
too, that canvases were hanging on the wall, and a large one, with
a big gondolier sketched on it, stood by the door. He was living
then in the Rio San Barnaba, and there Maud came to join him.
She could tell the whole story, but she will not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Bacher says Whistler wore a "large, wide-brimmed, soft, brown
hat tilted far back, suggesting a brown halo. It was a background
for his curly black hair and singular white lock.... A dark sack-coat
almost covered an extremely low turned-down collar, while a
narrow black ribbon did service as a tie, the long, pennant-like ends
of which, flapping about, now and then hit his single eye-glass."</p>

<p>Bacher describes him in evening dress without a tie, and Mr. Forbes
recalls his coming without one to the Bronson's, and Bronson saying it
was sad to see artists so poor that they could not afford a necktie.
Bacher also quotes Whistler as always substituting "Whistler" for
"I" in his talk, which we never knew him to do and it seems little
like him.</p>

<p>Several of Duveneck's pupils followed on from Florence in 1880,
and they lived in the Casa Jankovitz, the house that juts out squarely
at the lower end of the Riva degli Schiavoni, all Venice in front of it.
Whistler was enchanted with the place when he went to see them, and
moved there. He had one room, the windows looking over the Lagoon,
and from them the etchings and pastels of the Riva and the Lagoon
were made. Many things are told of this room, of plates bitten
on the top of the bureau, the acid running down, and the scramble
to save his shirts in the drawers beneath. Other stories are of the
printing-press on which Canaletto's plates may have been pulled and
many of Duveneck's and Bacher's were; the press which used to work
up to a certain point and then go with such a rush that it had to be
stopped, for fear the bed would come out on the floor.</p>

<p>There was a large colony of foreign artists and art lovers and a club,
English in name, really cosmopolitan, in Venice, where Whistler met
Rico, Wolkoff, Van Haanen, Tito, Blaas, if he had not already met them
on the Piazza. Alexander, Rolshoven, De Camp, and Bacher were with
Duveneck. Harper Pennington came in the autumn, and Scott, Ross
Turner, Blum, Woods, Bunney, Jobbins, and Logsdail were amongst the
other men he knew. The American Consul Grist, and the Vice-Consul
Graham, were persons of importance, and the United States Consulate
a meeting-place. Mrs. Bronson lived in Casa Alvisi, the Brownings
and the Curtises had houses in Venice, and with all three families
Whistler became intimate. Londoners turned up. Harry Quilter told
of one encounter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the spring of 1880 I spent a few weeks in Venice. I had been
drawing for about five days, in one of the back canals, a specially beautiful
doorway, when one morning I heard a sort of war-whoop, and there
was Whistler, in a gondola, close by, shouting out as nearly as I can
remember: 'Hi, hi! What! What! Here, I say, you've got my
doorway!' 'Your doorway? Confound your doorway!' I replied.
'It's my doorway, I've been here for the last week.' 'I don't care a
straw, I found it out first. I got that grating put up.' 'Very much
obliged to you, I'm sure; it's very nice. It was very good of you.'
And so for a few minutes we wrangled, but seeing that the canal was very
narrow, and that there was no room for two gondolas to be moored
in front of the chosen spot, mine being already tied up exactly opposite,
I asked him if he would not come and work in my gondola. He did so,
and, I am bound to say, turned the tables on me cleverly. For, pretending
not to know who I was, he described me to myself, and recounted
the iniquities of the art critic of the <i>Times</i>, one ''Arry Quilter.'"</p>

<p>Everybody says Whistler was penniless in Venice, always borrowing,
why, we do not know, unless the money went to pay for things in
London. But there were dinners and Sunday breakfasts. Many
were given in a little open-air <i>trattoria</i>, near the Via Garibaldi. The
Panada, the noisiest of noisy restaurants, was one of his haunts, and
there was another opposite the old post-office. The food, "nothing
but fowl," he wrote, tired him so that he surprised himself by spending
a fortune on tea, and carrying home strange pieces of fat, which he
tried to fry into resemblance of the slices of bacon served by Mrs.
Cossens, his Chelsea housekeeper. Mr. Scott says:</p>

<p>"If Whistler could not lay a table, he knew how to turn out tasty
little dishes over a spirit-lamp; and it was not long before the inevitable
Sunday breakfasts were instituted in that little room. <i>Polenta à
l' Américaine</i>, which he had induced the landlady to prepare under his
direction, we used to eat with such sort of treacle, alias golden syrup,
as could be obtained. Fish was cheaper and more plentiful then than
now in the Water City, and the lanky serving-women could fry with
the best of the famous Ciozzotte. The 'thin red wine' of the country,
in large flasks at about sixpence a quart, was plentiful, and these simple
things, with the accompanying 'flow of soul' made a feast for the
gods. There was no room for many guests at one time, but Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Woods, Ruben, W. Graham, Butler, and Roussoff were often with
us."</p>

<p>Days were spent on the Lido, and, doubtless he went to Chioggia,
Murano, Burano, and Torcello. These little journeys were more
costly and difficult then than now, and there are no plates except of
the <i>Lido</i> and the <i>Murano Glass-Furnace</i>, and no pastels except one or
two on the Lido.</p>

<p>Whistler loved the nights at the never-closed clubs in the Piazza,
Florian's and the Quadri, or the Orientale on the Riva, where the coffee
was just as good and two <i>centessimi</i> cheaper. Around these nights
endless legends are growing, and like all the legends, they are such a
part of Whistler they cannot be ignored. No one delighted in them
more than he, no one ever told them so well. They became the
favourite yarns of Duveneck's boys, to which we listened many an
evening when we came to Venice four years later. It was then we
first heard of Wolkoff, or Roussoff as he is known in Bond Street, and
his boast that he could make pastels like Whistler's and the Americans'
bet of a champagne dinner that he couldn't, and the evening in the
Casa Jankovitz, when Rico, Duveneck, Curtis, Bacher, Woods, and
Van Haanen recognised Wolkoff's work and every time one of his
pastels was produced cried: "Take it away!" The Russian said to
Whistler after dinner: "You know, you scratch a Russian, and you
find a Tartar!" "Ha ha!" said Whistler, "I've scratched an artist
and found an ama-Tartah!" Another story was of the tiny glass
figure, or maybe a little black baby from the shrine of St. Anthony at
Padua, dropped into Whistler's glass of water at the <i>café</i>, where it looked
like a little devil bobbing up and down, so that Whistler, when he saw it,
thought something was wrong with his eyes, and sipped the water and
shook the glass, and the more he sipped and shook the more the little
devil danced, and finally he upset the glass over everybody, and the little
demon fell in his lap. And there was another of the night when a
<i>barca</i>, with a transparency showing Nocturnes and a band playing
"Yankee-Doodle," moved up and down the Grand Canal and along the
Riva, never stopping until it was greeted with a loud "Ha ha!" from
the darkness. And we heard of the day when Whistler, seeing Bunney
on a scaffold struggling with St. Mark's, his life-work for Ruskin,
fastened a card, "I am totally blind," to his coat-tail. And we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
told of the hot noon when Whistler, leaning out of his window, discovering
a bowl of goldfish below on the window-ledge of his landlady,
against whom he had a grudge, let down a fishing-line, caught the fish,
fried them, dropped them back into the bowl, and watched the return of
their owner, who was sure her fish had been fried by the sun. And the
story of Blum and Whistler, without a <i>schei</i>, crossing the Academy
Bridge, Blum sticking in his eye a little watch with a split second-hand
that went round so fast the keeper thought he had the evil eye, and they
got over without paying; or of the boys' farewell <i>fête</i> to Whistler in
August when it was rumoured he was going, and in a coal barge, which
Bacher transforms into a "fairy-like floating bower festooned with the
wealth of autumn," a feast of melons and salads and Chianti was spread
and eaten as they drifted up the Grand Canal with the tide, the lights of
their lanterns bringing everyone to stare, until the rain drove them
under the Rialto, where they spent the rest of the night, and then
Whistler didn't go after all. When Whistler left they say he asked the
authors of these adventures up to his room and showed them a number
of prints, and said, "Now, you boys have been very good to me all
this time and I want to do something for you," and he turned over his
prints carefully, and said, "I have thought it out," and he took one,
a spoiled one, and he counted their heads, and he cut it into as
many pieces as there were people, and presented a fragment to
each, and as they marched downstairs all they heard was "Ha
ha!" These, and hundreds like them, are the legends you hear on
the Piazza.</p>

<p>Two friends of the Venetian days, Mr. Harper Pennington and Mr.
Ralph Curtis, have sent us their impressions. Mr. Harper Pennington
writes us: "He gave me many lessons there in Venice. He would hook
his arm in mine and take me off to look at some Nocturne that he was
studying or memorising, and then he would show me how he went about
to paint it&mdash;in the daytime. He let me&mdash;invited me, indeed, to stand
at his elbow as he set down in colour some effect he loved from the

canvases, all of them&mdash;I do not know. <i>The St. George Nocturne</i>, Canfield

<p>"There was an upright sunset, too, looking from my little terrace
on the Riva degli Schiavoni over towards San Giorgio, and others that
I saw him work on in 1880."</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis gives us other details: "Shortly before his return to
England with some of the etchings and the pastels, he gave his friends
a tea-dinner. As seeing the best of his Venetian work was the real
feast, the hour for the <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i>, consisting of sardines, hard-boiled
eggs, fruit, cigarettes, and excellent coffee prepared by the ever-admirable
Maud, was arranged for six o'clock. Effective pauses
succeeded the presentation of each masterpiece. During these
<i>entr'actes</i> Whistler amused his guests with witty conjectures as to the
verdict of the grave critics in London on 'these things.' One of his
favourite types for sarcasm used to be the eminently respectable
Londoner who is '<i>always</i> called at 8.30, closed-shaved at a quarter to
9, and in the City at 10.' 'What will he make of <i>this</i>? Serve him
right too! Ha ha!'</p>

<p>"Whistler was a constant and ever-welcome guest at Casa Alvisi,
the hospitable house of Mrs. Bronson, whom he often called <i>Santa
Cattarina Seconda</i>. During happy years, from lunch till long past
bedtime, her house was the open rendezvous for the rich and poor, the
famous and the famished, <i>les rois en exil</i> and the heirs-presumptive to
the thrones of fame. Whistler there had his place, and he held the
floor. One night a curious contrast was the great and genial Robert
Browning commenting on the projected form of a famous 'Jimmy
letter' to the <i>World</i>.</p>

<p>"Very late, on hot <i>scirocco</i> nights, long after the concert crowd had
dispersed, one little knot of men might often been seen in the deserted
Piazza, sipping refreshment in front of Florian's. You might be sure
that was Whistler in white duck, praising France, abusing England, and
thoroughly enjoying Italy. He was telling how he had seen painting
in Paris revolutionised by innovators of powerful handling: Manet,
Courbet, Vollon, Regnault, Carolus Duran. He felt far more enthusiasm
for the then recently resuscitated popularity of Velasquez and
Hals.</p>

<p>"The <i>ars celare artem</i> of Terborgh and Vermeer always delighted
him&mdash;the mysterious technique, the discreet distinction of execution,
the 'one skin all over it,' of the minor masters of Holland was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
his eloquent themes. To Whistler it was a treat when a Frenchman
arrived in Venice. If he could not like his paint, he certainly enjoyed
his language. French seemed to give him extra exhilaration. From
beginning to end he owed much to the French for first recognising
what he had learned from Japan."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII: VENICE.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY-NINE
AND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY CONTINUED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> in Whistler's life is more astonishing than the praise and
blame raised by the Venetian pastels on their exhibition in London.
Artists fought over them. To some, they were original, they gave
the character of Venice; to others, they were cheap, anybody could
do them. Both were wrong, as both always were. "Anybody"
cannot do them; he had been making pastels: the subject, not the
method, was new. Had some of the combatants visited the Academy
at Venice, they might have discovered his inspiration in the drawings
of the Old Masters, where he had found it years before at the Louvre.
He was only carrying on tradition.</p>

<p>Whistler used coloured paper for the pastels because it gave him,
without any work, the foundation of his colour-scheme in the simplest
manner, and because he could work straight away on it, and not
ruin the surface and tire himself getting the tone. Bacher describes
him in his gondola laden with pastels. But his materials were so few
that he could wander on foot in the narrow streets, the best way to
work as everyone who has worked in Venice knows. For it is difficult
to find again a place, and impossible to see again the effect, that
fascinated you. He carried only a little portfolio or drawing-board,
some sheets of tinted paper, black chalk, half a dozen pastels, and
varnished or silver-coated paper to cover the drawing when finished.
Once he found what he wanted, he made a sketch in black chalk and
then with pastel hinted the colour of the walls, the shutters, the spots
of the women's dresses, putting in the colour as in mosaic or stained
glass between the black lines, never painting, but noting the right
touch in the right place, keeping the colour pure. It looked so
easy, "only the doing it was the difficulty," he would say. When
he finished the drawings he showed them. Mr. Scott recalls that
"the latest pastels used to be brought out for inspection. Whistler
would always show his sketches in his own way or not at all. In the
absence of a proper easel and a proper light, they were usually laid on
the floor."</p>

<p>The "painter fellows" were startled by their brilliancy, Whistler
told his mother, and he thought rather well of them himself.</p>

<p>The pastels have been praised with the inconsequence characteristic
of so much praise of his work. The drawing often is either
not good in itself or so slight as to be of little importance. The beauty
is in the suggestion of colour or the arrangement of line. Though
he passed the spring, summer, winter, and part of two autumns in
the city there is no attempt, save in a few sunsets, to give atmospheric
effect, or the season, or the time of year. What he saw that pastel
would do, what he made it do, was to record certain lines and to suggest
certain colours. Critics and artists, having never studied pastel, were
unaware of what had been done with it. The revival did not come
for some years after Whistler showed his Venetian series, when there
was a "boom" all over the world, and pastel societies were started,
most of which have since collapsed.</p>

<p>The "boom" in etching commenced years before Whistler went
to Venice. There were standards: Whistler had already accomplished
great things, after a formula laid down by Dürer, Rembrandt,
and Hollar. Therefore, when he made etchings which struck the
uncritical, and even those who cared, as something new, the uncritical
were shocked because their preconceived notions were upset, and those
who cared were astonished. The difference between the Venetian
and the London plates was so great that the two series might be attributed
to two men. This was due partly to the difference between
London and Venice seen by an artist sensitive to the character of
places, but more to the difference of technique between the earlier
and the later plates. Not so many years ago, talking to him about
this subject, we said that the Venetian plates seemed to be done in
a new way. It so happened that the <i>Adam and Eve&mdash;Old Chelsea</i>
and <i>The Traghetto</i> were, as they are now, hanging almost side by side
on our walls. In five minutes he proved that one was the outgrowth
of the other, and that there was a natural development from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
beginning of his work. Until the London Memorial Exhibition it
was impossible to trace this, because the prints had never been
hung together chronologically, not even at the Grolier Club, in New
York, where, for want of space, two separate shows were made. Before
Whistler exhibited his Venetian plates most people knew nothing
but the French Set and the Thames Set. The intermediate stages
had not been followed, and the Venetian plates seemed a new thing.
But the difference between them and the Thames series is one of
development. Whistler always spoke of the <i>Black Lion Wharf</i> as
boyish, though it is impossible to conceive of anything of its kind
more complete. His estimate has been accepted by many. Mr.
Bernhard Sickert, in writing of it, thinks it misleading to say that
every tile, every beam has been drawn. "These details are merely
filled in with a certain number of strokes of a certain shape, accepted
as indicating the materials of which they are constructed." When
an etching is in pure line and owes little to the printer, as in this case,
it is the wonderful arrangement of lines, the wonderful lines themselves,
which make you feel that everything, every beam and every
tile, has been drawn; that every detail actually has been drawn we did
not suppose anybody would be so absurd as to imagine. The character
of the lines gives you this impression, which is exactly what the artist
wanted, and this is what proved Whistler an impressionist. Another
critic has said that Whistler exhausted all his blacks on the houses.
He did nothing of the sort. He concentrated them there, and did
not take away from the interest of the wharf he was drawing by an
equal elaboration in the boats, the barges, and the figures. As he
learned more he gave up his literal, definite method. Instead of
drawing the panes of a window in firm outline, he suggested them by
drawing the shadows and the reflected lights with short strokes, and
scarcely any outline. In the London plates he got the effect on his
buildings by different bitings. In Venice he suggested the shadows.
In both, the figures in movement are nearly the same, but there is
a great advance in the drawing in the Venice plates, where they give the
feeling of life. In the <i>Millbank</i> and the <i>Lagoon</i>, the subjects, or the
dominating lines in the subjects, are the same, a series of posts carrying
the eye from the foreground to the extreme distance, but their treatment
in the Venetian plate, as well as the drawing of the figures, is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
expressive. Simplicity of expression has never been carried further.
Probably the finest plate, in its simplicity and directness, is <i>The Bridge</i>.
Whistler now obtained the quality of richness by suggesting detail,
and also by printing. In <i>The Traghetto</i> there is the same scheme as
in <i>The Miser</i> and <i>The Kitchen</i>, but the Venice plate is more painter-like.
Without taking away from the etched line he has given a fullness
of tone which makes the background of <i>The Burgomaster Six</i>
weak in comparison. And he knew this.</p>

<p>He was doing his own printing for the first time to any extent.
There were a hundred prints of the first Venice Set. All were not
pulled by him, and the difference between his printing and Goulding's,
done after his death, is unmistakable. In the hand of any professional
printer plates like <i>The Traghetto</i> and <i>The Beggars</i> would
be a mass of scratches, though scratches of interest to the artist;
it required Whistler's printing to bring out what he wanted. And
it is the more surprising that he could print in Venice, so primitive
was the press. Bacher had a portable press, but most was done on
the old press. Whistler protested against the professional printer,
his pot of treacle and his couches of ink. But no great artist ever
carried the printing of etchings so far or made such use of printer's
ink as he did in these plates. Without the wash of ink, they would
be ghosts, and he was justified in printing as he wanted to get what
he wished. And he used ink in all sorts of ways on the same plate,
he tried endless experiments with ever-varying results, even to cover
up the weak lines of an indifferent design, as in <i>Nocturne&mdash;Palaces</i>,
prized highly by collectors, but one of his poorest Venice plates. It,
and <i>The Garden</i>, <i>Nocturne&mdash;Shipping</i>, and one or two besides are by
no means equal to the others in line, though some of his prints of
these are superb. But there are no such perfect plates in the world as
<i>The Beggars</i>, <i>The Traghetto</i>, the two <i>Rivas</i>, <i>The Bridge</i>, and <i>Rialto</i>.</p>

<p>While printing Whistler continually worked on his plates, and
instead of there being&mdash;as the authorities say&mdash;half a dozen states
there are a hundred; only the authorities cannot see. A curious
fact about <i>The Traghetto</i> is that there were two plates. He was
displeased with the first and etched it again. Bacher writes
that <i>The Traghetto</i> "troubled him very much." He pulled one
fine proof and then overworked the plate so that he had to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
a second. He got copper of the same size and thickness made
by the Venetian from whom they had their plates. When this was
ready, the first plate was inked with white paint instead of black ink.
This was placed on the second varnished plate, and they were then
run through the press. The result was "a replica in white upon the
black etching ground." Bacher says that on the new plate Whistler
worked for days and weeks with the first proof before him, that he
might find and etch only the original lines. When the second was
printed Whistler placed the two proofs side by side and minutely
compared them. And he was pleased, for the examination ended in the
one song he allowed himself in Venice:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i4"><i>"We don't want to fight,</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>But, by jingo! if we do,</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>We've got the ships,</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>We've got the men,</i></div>
<div class="i4"><i>And got the money too-oo-oo!"</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The early proofs of others plates were unsatisfactory. Each proof
was a trial, and, as each was pulled, he worked upon the plate, not
generally taking out large slabs or putting in new passages to make
a new state of it, but strengthening lines or lightening them, giving
richness to a shadow or modelling to a little figure. It would be
impossible, if the hundred proofs of each of these Venetian plates
were not shown together, to say how much he did or what he did to
each, but the first proof is quite different from the last and no two are
alike. Some of them, from ghosts, became solid facts.</p>

<p>In his Venice etchings Whistler also developed what he called the
Japanese method of drawing, Bacher calls his secret, and Mr. Menpes
the secret of drawing. Whistler always spoke frankly about it to us,
from the first time J. saw him etching, and he followed the same
method in his lithographs. In etching or lithography it is difficult
to make corrections, the surface of the plate or the stone should not
be disturbed, it is not easy, by the ordinary manner in which drawing
is taught, to put a complicated design on the plate without elaborate
spacing, tracing, or a preliminary sketch. Frequently, when the design
is half made in the usual fashion, the artist finds that the point of greatest
interest, the subject of his picture, will not come on the plate where
he wants it. The Japanese always seem to get the design in their
colour-prints in the right place, and yet their technique adds to the
difficulty of changing or altering a design, especially in their wood
blocks. But whether this is because they have the method of drawing
Whistler attributed to them, whether he got his idea from their completed
prints or evolved it, we do not know. We do know that the idea
was his long before he painted the Japanese pictures. You can see
the beginning of it in the <i>Isle de la Cité</i>. The system, scientific as
all his systems were, is to select the exact spot on the canvas, the lithographic
stone, the copper plate, or the piece of paper, where the focus
of interest is to be, and to draw this part of the subject first. It
might be near the side of a plate, though he insisted that the composition
should be placed well within the frame or on the plate, contrary
as such treatment is to Japanese methods and his early practice. In
the early paintings, sprays of flowers or branches of trees run into
the picture to give the impression that it is carried beyond the frame,
as the Japanese do. But his theory, perfected before the Venetian
period and adhered to as long as he lived, was that everything should
be well within the frame or plate mark, as far within as the subject
was from him. Having selected the point of interest, he drew that,
and drew it completely, and there, on his canvas, plate, or stone, was a
picture. It might be a distant view of palaces or shipping beneath
a bridge; in London, a shop window; in Paris, a dark doorway; in
portraits, the sitter's head. Once he put it down, he drew in the
objects next in importance, all the while carrying out the work completely
and making one harmonious whole. The result was that the
picture was finished&mdash;"finished from the beginning"&mdash;and there was
on the plate, paper, or stone a space which he could fill with less
important details or leave as he chose. With his painting it was a
different problem. When the subject was arranged, it grew together
all over, at the same time. In some of the earlier pictures, <i>Old Battersea
Bridge</i> for example, a piece of canvas seems to have been added, though
he maintained that the artist should confine himself to the size of
the canvas he selected, and not get over his blunders, as many do,
by adding to or taking from the canvas. All this requires the
greatest care in just what Whistler considered most important, the
placing of the subject. Working in this manner, always with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
completed picture in his mind, he could return again, add further
work if he thought it was needed, knowing he had his subject drawn.
It sounds simple, so simple that one day, when he had been explaining
it to Mr. E. A. Walton, and the latter said, "But there is no secret!"
Whistler's answer was, "Yes, the secret is in doing it." It is just
this, "in doing it," that the excellence of his work lies. As a matter
of fact the difficulty is restraint in drawing the heart of a subject,
while in painting still more restraint is necessary, the restraint imposed
by colour and the medium.</p>

<p>Besides etchings and pastels Whistler made water-colours in Venice,
but as they were never shown together it is impossible to say how many.
There were also a few oils. The most important is <i>Nocturne, Blue
and Gold, St. Mark's</i>. Bacher speaks of one from the windows of the
Casa Jankovitz, "the Salute and a great deal of sky and water, with
the buildings very small," and of a scene at night from a <i>café</i> near the
Royal Gardens. Then there is the upright sunset from the Riva
referred to by Mr. Pennington, and two others painted from Mr.
Ross Turner's terrace, one looking down the Riva to San Biagio, the
other up to San Marco, both full of little figures, and with boats and
a suggestion of the Lagoon, in the background; studies left hanging
in sunlight after he had done one day's work until he came to do the
next. Mr. Forbes recalls a <i>Nocturne of the Giudecca</i>, with shipping,
on a panel, which Whistler gave to Jobbins, who, as he told us, thought
so little of it that he painted a sketch on the back and then sold it to
Forbes, who still has it. Canfield was said to have another of S.
Giorgio. Doubtless there are more, but we know of none that were
exhibited.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII: BACK IN LONDON.<br /> THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-ONE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of November 1880 Whistler was back in London. "Years
of battle," M. Duret calls the period that followed, and Whistler was
ready to fight.</p>

<p>He arrived when the Fine Art Society had a show of "Twelve
Great Etchers," a press was in the gallery, Goulding was printing,
etching was upon the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you know, I was just home; nobody had seen me, and
I drove up in a hansom. Nobody expected me. In one hand I held
my long cane; with the other I led by a ribbon a beautiful little white
Pomeranian dog; it too had turned up suddenly. As I walked in
I spoke to no one, but putting up my glass I looked at the prints on
the wall. 'Dear me! dear me!' I said, 'still the same old sad work!
Dear me!' And Haden was there, talking hard to Brown, and laying
down the law, and as he said 'Rembrandt,' I said 'Ha ha!' and he
vanished, and then&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He was without house or studio, and stopped in Wimpole Street
with his brother until he took lodgings in Langham Street and then
in Alderney Street. (The record of this is in the etching published
in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, April 1881.) He set to work printing
the plates, for few had been pulled in Venice. The Fine Art Society
moved Goulding's press upstairs and friends came to see him, and here
Mr. Mortimer Menpes says he first met Whistler, and, dropping
Poynter, South Kensington, and his ambition, threw himself at the
feet of "the Master" and called himself pupil. It was not an ideal
workshop, and the Fine Art Society took two rooms for Whistler in
Air Street, Regent Street, on the first floor, with a bow window under
the colonnade, now the Piccadilly Hotel: the window from which he
etched the plate of the Quadrant.</p>

<p>T. Way and his son came to Air Street to help Whistler print.
The press was in the front room, and T. R. Way made a sketch of it
in colour, his father damping paper, Whistler inking a plate, the press
between them: an interesting document. The work was interrupted
by excitement. One day Whistler placed on the heater a bottle of
acid tightly stopped up. The stopper blew out, steaming acid fumes
filled the room, and they ran for their lives. Another time, they took
caustic potash, or something as deadly, to get the dried ink out of the
lines of the plates, and they dropped the bottle on the floor, and there
was not much left of the carpet. Why anything was left of the floor
or of them is a mystery. Then, Mr. Menpes says:</p>

<p>"Whistler drifted into a room in my house, which I had
fitted up with printing materials, and it was in this little printing-room
of mine that most of the series of Venetian etchings were
printed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The edition of a hundred sets was, however, not completed during
Whistler's lifetime. It was only after his death that Goulding finished
the work.</p>

<p>The first series of twelve Venetian plates was shown in December
1880 at the Fine Art Society's. The <i>Twelve</i> were selected from the
forty plates Whistler brought back. The critics could see nothing
in them. They were dismissed as "another crop of Whistler's little
jokes." One after another the people's authorities repeated the
Attorney-General's decision that Whistler was amusing, and Burne-Jones'
regret that he had not fulfilled his early promise, and Whistler
collected the criticisms for future use.</p>

<p>Brown, of the Fine Art Society, took to New York a set of the
proofs. Whistler spent a Sunday pulling them. But the etchings
were no more appreciated in New York than in London. Only eight
sets were ordered.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Whistler was preparing his exhibition of pastels.
Mr. Cole notes in his diary:</p>

<p>"<i>January 2</i> (1881). Jimmy called, as self-reliant and sure as
ever, full of confidence in the superlative merit of his pastels, which
we are to go and see."</p>

<p>This exhibition also was held at the Fine Art Society's. Whistler
designed the frames; he wrote the catalogue, which had the brown paper
cover, but not quite the form eventually adopted, and it was printed
by Way; he decorated the gallery, an arrangement in gold and brown,
which was enjoyed as another of his little jokes by the critics.
Godwin was one of the few who admitted the beauty, and his description
in the <i>British Architect</i> (February 1881) is on record:</p>

<p>"First, a low skirting of yellow gold, then a high dado of dull
yellow-green cloth, then a moulding of green gold, and then a frieze
and ceiling of pale reddish brown. The frames are arranged on the
line; but here and there one is placed over another. Most of the
frames and mounts are of rich yellow gold, but a dozen out of
the fifty-three are in green gold, dotted about with a view of decoration,
and eminently successful in attaining it."</p>

<p>On the evening of the Press view Mr. Cole says:</p>

<p>"<i>January 28</i> (1881). Whistler turned up for dinner very full of
his private view to-morrow. Later on, we concocted a letter inviting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Prince Teck to come to it. His last draft was all right, but he
would insist on beginning it 'Prince,' although I assured him 'Sir'
was the usual way of addressing him in a letter."</p>

<p>The private view (January 29) was a crush, Bond Street blocked
with carriages, the sidewalk crowded; nothing like it was ever known
at the Fine Art Society's. Millais, showing forgotten <i>machines</i> in
the adjoining room, was one of the first to see the pastels. "Magnificent,
fine; very cheeky, but fine!" he bellowed, and afterwards
said so to Whistler, who was pleased. The crowd did not know what
to say, and, had they known, would have been afraid to say it. For
Whistler was there, his laugh louder, shriller than ever. He let no
one forget the trial. An admirer asked the price of a pastel: "Sixty
guineas! That's enormous!" Whistler heard, though he was not
meant to; he heard everything. "Ha ha! Enormous! Why, not
at all! I can assure you it took me quite half an hour to do it!"</p>

<p>People laughed at Whistler's work, because they thought they were
expected to. Because he was the gayest man they refused to see
that he was the most serious artist. When they laughed at his art,
it hurt; when they laughed at him, they suffered; and he had his
revenge in mystifying them:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, they thought it was an amiability to me for them
to be amused. One day, when I was on my way to the Fine Art
Society's, while the show was going on, I met Sir and Lady &mdash;&mdash;
face to face, at the door, as they were coming out. Both looked very
much bored, but they couldn't escape me. So the old man grasped
my hand and chuckled, 'We have just been looking at your things,
and have been so much amused!' He had an idea that the drawings
on the wall were drolleries of some sort, though he could not understand
why, and that it was his duty to be amused. I laughed with
him. I always did with people of that kind, and then they said I was
not serious."</p>

<p>The critics, too, laughed, but there was venom in their laughter.
They liked to take themselves, if they couldn't take Whistler, seriously,
and they hated work they could not understand. The pastels were
sensational, Whistler was clever with a sort of transatlantic impudence.
They objected to the brown paper, to the technique, to the frames,
to the decorations, to the subjects; they became unexpectedly concerned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
for the past glory of Venice. Godwin, again, was an exception
"No one who has listened, as the writer of these notes has, to Whistler's
descriptions of the open-arcaded, winding staircase that lifts its tall
stem far into the blue sky, or of the façades, yet unrestored, that speak
of the power of the Venetian architect, can doubt that he who can so remember
and describe has failed to admire. It is by reason of the strength
of this admiration and appreciation that he holds back in reverence,
and exercises this reticence of the pencil, the needle, and the brush."</p>

<p>A number of people showed their belief in the pastels by buying
them, and the exhibition was a success financially. The prices ranged
from twenty to sixty guineas, the total receipts amounted to eighteen
hundred pounds. Bacher quotes a letter written to him just after the
show opened signed "Maud Whistler": "The best of it is, all the
pastels are selling. Four hundred pounds' worth the first day; now
over a thousand pounds' worth are sold."</p>

<p>Before the show closed, at the end of January, Whistler was
summoned to Hastings. His mother had been there since her illness
of 1876-77, from which she never entirely recovered, though there
were intervals between the attacks when her family had no cause for
anxiety. But her death was sudden. Those who refused to see in
Whistler any other good quality could not deny his devotion to his
mother; those to whom he revealed the tenderness under the defiant
masque with which he faced the world knew what his love for her
meant to him. She had lived with him whenever it was possible.
His visits and letters to Hastings had been frequent. He never forgot
her birthday. He told her of all his success, all his hopes, and made
as light as he could of his debts and disappointments. But in the
miserable week before the funeral at Hastings he was full of remorse;
he should have been kinder and more considerate, he said; he had not
written often enough from Venice. Dr. Whistler was with him part
of the time, and the Doctor's wife the rest. In the afternoons they
wandered on the windy cliffs above the town, and there was one drear
afternoon when he broke down: "It would have been better had I been
a parson as she wanted!" Yet he had nothing to reproach himself with.
The days in Chelsea were for her as happy as for him, and she whose
pride had been in his first childish promise at St. Petersburg lived to see
the development of his powers. She is buried at Hastings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>It was fortunate that when he got back to town there were events
to distract his thoughts. The Society of Painter-Etchers opened
their first exhibition in April at the Hanover Gallery. American
artists who were just starting etching and had never shown prints in
London were invited. Frank Duveneck sent a series of Venetian
proofs. This was the occasion of "the storm in an æsthetic teapot,"
which, had not Whistler thought it important as "history," would
be forgotten. We quote, as he did, from <i>The Cuckoo</i> (April 11,
1881):</p>

<p>"Some etchings, exceedingly like Mr. Whistler's in manner, but
signed 'Frank Duveneck,' were sent to the Painter-Etchers' Exhibition
from Venice. The Painter-Etchers appear to have suspected for a
moment that the works were really Mr. Whistler's, and, not desiring
to be the victims of an easy hoax on the part of that gentleman, three
of their members&mdash;Dr Seymour Haden, Dr. Hamilton, and Legros&mdash;went
to the Fine Art Society's Gallery in Bond Street, and asked
one of the assistants there to show them some of Mr. Whistler's Venetian
plates. From this assistant they learned that Mr. Whistler was
under an arrangement to exhibit and sell his Venetian etchings only
at the Fine Art Society's Gallery."</p>

<p>Whistler heard of this. He called on Mr. Cole, "highly incensed
with Haden and Legros conspiring to make out he was breaking his
contract with the Fine Art Society," and went at once to the Hanover
Gallery, Mr. Menpes with him. The three members fortunately
were not there. Then Haden wrote to the Fine Art Society that they
had found out about Mr. Duveneck and said they were delighted
with his etchings, and expressed regret. But it is incredible that
Haden and Legros should have mistaken the work of Duveneck for
that of Whistler. The story was published by Whistler in <i>The Piker
Papers</i>. With its interest a little dulled by time, the correspondence
may be read in <i>The Gentle Art</i>.</p>

<p>Whistler had not forgotten the pictures left with Graves in
Pall Mall. By degrees he bought them back. When Mr. Algernon
Graves consulted his father about letting Whistler have the pictures
upon which the full amount was not paid, after Whistler had repaid
a hundred pounds for three, the father said, "Let him take the whole
lot, and don't be a fool; the pictures aren't worth twenty-five pounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
apiece." The <i>Rosa Corder</i> was sold at Christie's with Howell's effects,
Mr. Algernon Graves agreeing that, if it brought more than Howell's
debt to the firm, Howell's executors could have the balance. The
father maintained the picture wouldn't fetch ten pounds, but it brought
more than the amount of their bill, some hundred and thirty pounds.
The <i>Irving</i> was sold to Sir Henry for a hundred pounds&mdash;at Irving's
sale it was bought by Mr. Thomas of Philadelphia for five thousand
guineas&mdash;and the <i>Miss Franklin</i> went to Messrs. Dowdeswell. Whistler
continued to pay his bills regularly as they came due, to Graves'
astonishment; there was only one exception, and then Whistler came
to ask to have the payment postponed, and this was not settled until
long after the pictures were in Whistler's possession. When Whistler
paid the final instalment Graves expressed his surprise. But Whistler
said: "You have been a very good friend to me; in fact, you have
been my banker. You have acted honourably to me in the whole
matter. I meant to pay, and I have done so."</p>

<p>These business details and his exhibitions left Whistler no time
in 1881 for the <i>Salon</i>, where he had nothing, or for the Grosvenor, to
which he sent only <i>Miss Alexander</i>. In the autumn, borrowing the
<i>Mother</i> from Graves, he lent it to the Academy in Philadelphia, the
arrangements being made by Mrs. Anna Lea Merritt, and this is
her account:</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1881 I was asked by the Pennsylvania Academy
of Fine Arts to receive pictures by American artists, and have them
forwarded for exhibition, and especially they entreated me to persuade
Mr. Whistler to send a picture. He had never been represented in
any American exhibition. I obtained a chance when meeting him
at a dinner of pressing the subject more vigorously than I could have
done by writing, and he promised to send his mother's portrait. It
was collected in due course and deposited in my studio, then in the
Avenue. Mr. Whistler came immediately after, and as the canvas
was breaking away from the stretcher, he directed the packing agents,
who were skilful frame-makers, to restrain it, and then left me. As
soon as the canvas was made tight, spots of crushed varnish appeared
on the surface. The varnish, in fact, broke or crumbled and I feared
the canvas might have broken. I flew down the street, overtook him,
and brought him back, dreading that he would blame us and even
that some injury had been done. To my surprise, he took the misfortune
with perfect composure and kindness, and stippled the spots
with some solvent varnish that soon restored the even surface. And
there was never a word of suggestion that we had done any harm.
Of course, I knew the fault was not in anything that had been done,
and it was by his own order, but from all I had heard about him I
trembled. The greatest difficulty in connection with that exhibition
was to persuade him to journey to the American Consulate in St. Helen's
Place and make his affidavit for the invoice. It had to be done by
himself; and it was not pleasant, as we know, to waste a day, the very
middle of the day, in this dull declaration of American citizen
sojourning in England. After the cases were ready for shipment there
was still delay to get his task accomplished, and I think the
Pennsylvania Academy hardly guess how much persuading it took.
What a pity they did not secure the beautiful picture for his own
country! Now that it hangs in the Luxembourg, they envy it."</p>

<p>The <i>Mother</i> was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1881,
and, on the suggestion of Mr. Alden Weir, at the Society of American
Artists in New York in 1882, and it could have been bought for a
thousand dollars. Although nobody wanted it, it made him known
in his own country as a painter. He was elected a member of the
Society of American Artists that year.</p>

<p>At this time, owing to the visit of Seymour Haden to the United
States, American artists became interested in etching, and societies
were formed and exhibitions held all over the country. There was
a show in the Boston Museum in 1881. Another, the first of a series,
was given by the New York Etching Club in 1882. And the Philadelphia
Society of Etchers organised in the same year an International
Exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts. Articles in <i>Scribner's</i> on
Whistler and Haden and American Etchers added to the interest.
Messrs. Cassell and others issued portfolios of prints, and every painter
became an etcher. The result was a boom, then a slump, out of which
Whistler and Haden almost alone emerged, for the reason that their
work was not done to please the public or the publishers. We remember
the excitement made by Haden's lectures which prepared America for
Whistler, whose prints were in both the New York and Philadelphia
Exhibitions. Mr. James L. Claghorn, almost the only Philadelphian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
who then cared for etchings, had already many Whistlers. Mr. Avery,
in New York, had some years before begun his collection and secured for
it many of the rarest proofs, and he was followed by Mr. Howard Mansfield,
who later on interested Mr. Charles L. Freer. But in America
more had been heard of Whistler's eccentricities than his work. It could
no longer remain unknown, once his etchings and the portrait of the
<i>Mother</i> were seen and <i>The White Girl</i> was lent to the Metropolitan
Museum in New York, where it hung for some time. And the young
men who had been with him in Venice, coming back, spread his fame
at home, and when Americans got to know his work they became
the keenest to possess it. Even at this time Avery owned the <i>Whistler
in the Big Hat</i>, Mr. Whittemore <i>The White Girl</i>, and Mrs. Hutton
the <i>Wapping</i>. That an American artist's works should be bought at
all by Americans at that date was extraordinary. Tadema, Bouguereau,
Meyer von Bremen were the standard, soon, however, to be
exchanged for Whistler, the Impressionists, and the Dutch and
Barbizon Schools.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV: THE JOY OF LIFE.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-ONE TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-FOUR.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">On </span> May 26, 1881, Mr. Cole "met Jimmie, who is taking a new studio
in Tite Street, where he is going to paint all the fashionables; views
of crowds competing for sittings; carriages along the streets."</p>

<p>It was No. 13, close to the White House. Whistler decorated it
in yellow: one "felt in it as if standing inside an egg," Howell said.
He again picked up blue and white, and old silver; he again gave Sunday
breakfasts, and they again became the talk of the town and he the
fashion. If the town was determined to talk, Whistler was willing
it should. He was never so malicious, never so extravagant, never
so joyous. He wrapped himself "in a species of misunderstanding."
He filled the papers with letters. London echoed with his laugh.
His white lock stood up defiantly above his curls; his cane lengthened;
a series of collars sprang from his long overcoat; his hat had a curlier
brim, a lower tilt over his eyes; he invented amazing costumes:
"in great form, with a new fawn-coloured long-skirted frock-coat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and extraordinary long cane," Mr. Cole found him one summer day
in 1882. He was known to pay calls with the long bamboo stick in
his hand and pink bows on his shoes. He allowed no break in the
gossip. The carriages brought crowds, but not sitters. Few would
sit to him before the trial; after it there were fewer. In the seventies
it needed courage to be painted by Whistler; now it was to risk
notoriety and ridicule. Lady Meux was the first to give him a commission.
Two of his three large full-lengths of her are amongst his
most distinguished portraits. She was handsome, of a luxuriant
type, her full-blown beauty a contrast to the elusive loveliness of
Maud in the <i>Fur Jacket</i>, or Mrs. Leyland, or Mrs. Huth. Whistler
found appropriate harmonies. One was an <i>Arrangement in White and
Black</i>. There is a sumptuousness in the velvet gown and the long
cloak he never surpassed, and the firm modelling of the face, neck,
and arms gives to the regal figure more solidity than he ever got before.
Whistler was pleased with it, spoke of it as his "beautiful Black Lady,"
and Lady Meux was so well pleased that she posed a second time.
In this, the <i>Harmony in Flesh Colour and Pink</i>, afterwards changed to
<i>Pink and Grey</i>, she wears a round hat low over her face, and a pink
bodice and skirt, and stands against a pink background, and the ugly
fashion of the day cannot conceal the beauty. The third portrait,
as far as we can find out, was never finished. Mr. Walter Dowdeswell
has a pen-and-ink drawing of it. She wears a fur cap, a sable coat,
and carries a muff. For this, it is said, after differences, a maid
posed and Whistler painted her face over the Lady's. Mr. Harper
Pennington says: "The only time I saw Jimmy stumped for a reply was
at a sitting of Lady Meux (for the portrait in sables). For some reason
Jimmy became nervous, exasperated, and impertinent. Touched by
something he had said, her ladyship turned softly towards him and
remarked, quite softly, 'See here, Jimmy Whistler! You keep a civil
tongue in that head of yours, or I will have in some one to <i>finish</i> those
portraits you have made of me!' with the faintest emphasis on 'finish.'
Jimmy fairly danced with rage. He came up to Lady Meux, his
long brush tightly grasped, and actually quivering in his hand, held
tight against his side. He stammered, spluttered, and finally gasped
out, 'How dare you? How dare you?' but that, after all, was <i>not</i>
an answer, was it? Lady Meux did not sit again. Jimmy never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
spoke of the incident afterwards, and I was sorry to have witnessed
it."</p>

<p>At the time of the London Memorial Exhibition Lady Meux
offered the Committee the two portraits in her possession on condition
that the third should be returned to her. This the Committee were
unable to do, and it was not until her will was published after her death,
in January 1911, in which she bequeathed the missing picture and the
correspondence relating to it to the National Gallery, that any more
was heard about it. Then a statement appeared in a New York
paper that the portrait was in the collection of Mr. Freer, and Miss
Birnie Philip stated in the <i>Times</i> that Whistler had destroyed the
picture which, according to Lady Meux in her will, "was ordered and
paid for by her husband, but it had never come into his possession nor
could it be found."</p>

<p>Sir Henry Cole posed for a second portrait and Whistler got back
from Mr. Way the first, discovered in one of the rolls of canvases he
bought at the sale. Mr. Cole saw the second portrait in the studio:</p>

<p>"<i>February 26</i> (1882). Found his commencement of my father,
good but slight, full length, evening clothes, long dark cloak thrown
back, red ribbon of Bath."</p>

<p>"<i>April 17</i> (1882). In spite of his illness, my father to Whistler's,
who fretted him by not painting; my father thought that Jimmy
had merely touched the light on his shoes, and nothing else, although
he stood and sat for over an hour and a half."</p>

<p>This was the last sitting. The next day Sir Henry Cole died
suddenly: a distinguished official lost to England, a friend lost to
Whistler. Eldon, an artist much with Whistler at the time, was in
the studio on the 17th, and recalled afterwards that Sir Henry Cole's
last words on leaving were, "Death waits for no man!" Whistler
meant to go on with the portrait. On May 2 Mr. Cole went again
to Tite Street: "After a long delay, Jimmy showed me his painting
of my father, which J. can make into a very good thing."</p>

<p>It is said not to have been finished, but we possess a photograph
of it which shows no want of finish. This also, Mr. Cole was informed,
Whistler destroyed. Neither was a full-length of Eldon finished:
a fine thing, to judge from the photograph we have seen. It also has
vanished, though a small half-length, sent to the London Memorial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Exhibition, but not hung&mdash;it may be a copy&mdash;is now in New York.
During the next few years other portraits were begun, and of several
we have photographs which it is not possible to identify. An <i>Arrangement
in Yellow</i> was of Mrs. Langtry. For a new version of his scheme
of "blue upon blue" Miss Maud Waller posed. Mrs. Marzetti, her
sister, who went with her to the studio, writes:</p>

<p>"The sittings commenced in the early part of 1882. We went
two or three times, and then Whistler painted the face out, as it was
not to his liking, although most people thought it excellent. In those
days Maud was very beautiful. The picture was started on a canvas
that already had a figure on it, and it was turned upside down, and
the <i>Blue Girl's</i> head painted in between the legs. The dress was made
by Mme. Alias, the theatrical costumier, to Whistler's design, and
I believe cost a good deal. In the end the picture was finished from
another model (I do not know who), and was hung in one of Whistler's
exhibitions in Bond Street [<i>Notes, Harmonies, Nocturnes</i>, May
1884, at Dowdeswell's]: it is No. 31 in the catalogue, and called
<i>Scherzo in Blue&mdash;The Blue Girl</i>. This was the same exhibition in
which he hung the picture he gave me, and which in the end I never
got (No. 66, <i>Bravura in Brown</i>). I should have treasured it for two
reasons: Whistler's painting, and also that it was a portrait of Mr.
Ridley. The picture of Maud was to have been at the Grosvenor
Gallery, but was not finished. However, it was sent in for the
private view, and taken away again the same night or next morning.
We used thoroughly to enjoy our visits to the studio&mdash;that is to say, I
did, because I sat and looked on. I can't say whether Maud enjoyed
them as much; probably not, as we used to get down there about
eleven o'clock, have lunch, and stay all the afternoon, most of which
time she was standing.</p>

<p>"I cannot remember all the callers we used to see there, as there
were so many, but some of the more frequent visitors I remember
well. There was one man who was always there, all day long, and we
just hated him; I don't know why, as he seemed very harmless. He
was Whistler's shadow. I don't know who he was, but have an idea
that he used to write a bit. I think he was very poor, and that Whistler
pretty well kept him. I heard some few years ago that he died in a
lunatic asylum. Oscar Wilde was a frequent visitor, also Walter Sickert.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Whistler used to say, 'Nice boy, Walter!' he was very fond of him
then. Others I remember were two brothers named Story, Frank Miles
(who had a studio just opposite Whistler's)&mdash;Renée Rodd as Whistler
used to call him&mdash;Major Templar, Lady Archie Campbell, and Mrs.
Hungerford. Whistler was just finishing the portrait of Lady Meux,
and I stood for him one day for about five minutes. It was a full-length
portrait in black evening dress, with a big white cloak over the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Whistler was a most entertaining companion; he was very
fond of telling us Edgar Allan Poe's stories, and also of reciting <i>The
Lost Lenore</i>, which he said was his favourite poem. He dined with us
several times in Lyall Street; he was always late for dinner, sometimes
half an hour, and I think on more than one occasion was sound asleep
at the table before the end of the dinner.</p>

<p>"Whistler's usual breakfast, which he often had after we arrived
at the studio, was two eggs in a tumbler, beaten up with pepper, salt,
and vinegar, bread and coffee....</p>

<p>"Whistler stood yards away from the picture with his brush, and
would move it as though he were painting; he would then jump across
the room, and put a dab of paint on the canvas; he also used to wet
his finger and gently rub portions of his picture. I have often seen
him take a sponge with soap and water and wash the Blue Girl's face
(on the canvas, I mean)."</p>

<p>Lady Archibald Campbell, also posing for Whistler, said: "He
was a great friend of ours. I think I sat to him during a year
or so, off and on, for a great many studies in different costumes and
poses. His first idea was to paint me in court dress. The dress was
black velvet, the train was silver satin with the Argyll arms embroidered
in appliqué in their proper colours. He made a sketch of me in the
dress. The fatigue of standing with the train was too great, and he
abandoned the idea. In all these studies he called my attention to
his method of placing his subject well within the frame, explaining
that a portrait must be more than a portrait, must be of value decoratively.
He never patched up defects, but, if dissatisfied with any
portion of his work, covered the canvas afresh with his first impression
freshly recorded. The first impression thrown on the canvas he often
put away, often destroyed. Among others, he made in oils an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
impression of me as Orlando, in the forest scene of <i>As You Like It</i>,
at Coombe. He considered this successful. A picture he called <i>The
Grey Lady</i> was a harmony in silver greys. I remember thinking it a
masterpiece of drawing, giving the impression of movement. I was
descending a stair, the canvas was of a great height, and the general
effect striking. It was almost completed when my absence from
town prevented a continuance of the sittings. When I returned
he asked to make a study of me in the dress in which I called upon
him. This is the picture which he exhibited under the name of <i>The
Brodequin Jaune</i>, or <i>The Yellow Buskin</i>. As far as I remember it was
painted in a few sittings. When I saw him shortly before his death
I asked after <i>The Grey Lady</i>. He laughed and said he had destroyed
her."</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Sickert has recorded a number of interesting details
about these pictures, though his statements are vague. He says that
the canvases had a grey ground "made with black and white mixed
with turpentine," and that Whistler used a medium of oil and turpentine,
and "covered thinly the whole canvas with his prepared tones,
using house-painters' brushes for the surfaces, and drawing lines with
round hogshair brushes nearly a yard long.... His object was to
cover the whole canvas at one painting&mdash;either the first or the hundredth."
Lady Archibald asked him if he was going to touch up her
portrait at the last sitting. Whistler said, "Not touch it up, give it
another beautiful skin." Mr. Sickert also very aptly suggests the reason
why some of the portraits were never completed. Whistler did them
all over, again and again, till they were "finished&mdash;or wrecked, as
often happened, from the sitter getting tired, or growing up, or growing
old." Almost the only new fact in Mr. Frank Rutter's <i>Whistler</i> is
given him by Mr. Sickert, who says he remembers once Whistler standing
on a chair with a candle at the end of a sitting from Lady Archibald
Campbell, looking at his work, but undecided whether he should take
it out or leave it. They started to dinner, and in the street he decided,
saying, "You go back. I shall only be nervous and begin to doubt
again. Go back and take it all out." This, Mr. Sickert says he did,
with a rag and benzoline.</p>

<p>M. Duret suggests that the ridicule of her friends had an effect
on Lady Archibald Campbell, or perhaps her beauty made her critical;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
anyhow, she suggested changes to Whistler, who, though he seldom
accepted suggestions from his sitters, did his best to meet her, until
it seemed as if, to please her, he must repaint the picture, and he was
discouraged. We have heard of a scene outside the studio: Lady
Archibald in a hansom on the point of driving away never to return;
M. Duret springing on the step and representing the loss to the world
of the masterpiece, and arguing so well that she came back, and <i>The
Yellow Buskin</i> was saved from the fate of <i>The Grey Lady</i> and <i>The Lady
in Court Dress</i>. Some think the portrait that was finished is Whistler's
greatest. It has distinction and character. It is another <i>Arrangement
in Black</i> in which critics could then discover but dinginess and dirt. One
wit described it as a portrait of a lady pursuing the last train through
the smoke of the Underground. People have learned to see, or at
least to think they should see, beauty, and to-day they hardly dare deny
it is a masterpiece. Whistler called it first the <i>Portrait of Lady Archibald
Campbell</i>, but afterwards <i>The Yellow Buskin</i>, the title in the
Wilstach Collection, Philadelphia, where it now hangs.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Sickert tells an amusing story of Whistler's way sometimes
of meeting the suggestions of sitters:</p>

<p>"I remember an occasion when Whistler, yielding to persuasion,
allowed himself to introduce, step by step, certain modifications in
the scheme of a portrait that he was painting. As time went on he
saw his own conception overlaid with an image that he had never
intended. At last he stopped and put his brushes slowly down. Taking
off his spectacles, he said, 'Very well, that will do. This is your portrait.
We will put it aside and finish it another day.' 'Now, if you please,'
he added, dragging out a new grey canvas, 'we will begin mine.'"</p>

<p>M. Duret posed to Whistler at the same time as Lady Archibald
Campbell. When she could not come Whistler would telegraph him,
and day by day he watched the progress of her portrait while his was
growing. Business brought M. Duret to London. He had always
been much with artists in Paris, had been intimate with Courbet,
was still with Fantin, Manet, and Bracquemond. He recognised the
genius of men at whom the world scoffed, and it was he who by an
article in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> (April 1881) made the French
realise their mistake of years, and again give Whistler the place so long
denied him.</p>

<p>One evening in 1883, after a private view, Whistler and Duret
were talking over the pictures they had seen, and in discussing the
portrait of the President of some society, Whistler declared that red
robes of office were not in character with modern heads, and that a
man should be painted in the costume of his time, and he asked Duret
to pose to him that he might show what could be done with evening
dress, the despair of painters. The experiment was not so original
as Duret seemed to think. Leyland was painted in this way ten years
before, when Whistler proved the truth of Baudelaire's assertion that
the great colourist can get colour from a black coat, a white shirt,
against a dark background. Sir Henry Cole also posed in evening
dress. Whistler did not rely entirely upon so simple a scheme in his
portrait of Duret, who has a pink domino over his arm, a red fan in
his hand. His portrait is called <i>Arrangement in Flesh Colour and
Black</i>.</p>

<p>M. Duret describes Whistler at work. He marked slightly with
chalk the place for the figure on the canvas, and began at once to put
it in, in colour; at the end of the first sitting the scheme was there.
This was the method that delighted Whistler. The difficulty with him
was not to begin a portrait, but to finish it. The painting was brought
almost to completion, rubbed out, begun again, and repainted ten times.
Duret saw that it was a question not only of drawing, but of colour, of
tone, and understood Whistler's theory that to bring the whole into
harmony and preserve it the whole must be repainted as a whole, if
there was any repainting to be done. There are finer portraits, but
not many that show so well Whistler's meaning when he said that
colour is "the arrangement of colour." The rose of the domino,
the fan, and the flesh is so managed that the cold grey of the background
seems to be flushed with rose. Duret, when he showed the picture,
took a sheet of paper, cut a hole in it, and placed it against
the background, to prove that the grey, when surrounded by white,
is pure and cold without a touch of rose, and that Whistler got his
effect by his knowledge of the relation of colour and his mastery of tone.</p>

<p>The <i>Lady Meux&mdash;Black and White</i> went to the <i>Salon</i> of 1882, catalogued
as <i>Portrait de M. Harry&mdash;Men</i>, to the confusion of commentators.
The <i>Harmony in Flesh Colour and Pink</i> was shown at the Grosvenor with
<i>Nocturne in Blue and Silver</i>, <i>Scherzo in Blue&mdash;The Blue Girl</i>, <i>Nocturne</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<i>in Black and Gold&mdash;Southampton Water</i>, <i>Harmony in Black and Red</i>,
<i>Note in Black and Opal&mdash;Jersey</i>, <i>Blue and Brown&mdash;San Brelade's Bay</i>.
The <i>Times</i> was unable to decide whether Whistler was making fun
of them or whether something was wrong with his eyes. The <i>Pall
Mall</i> regretted that "if the <i>Lady Meux</i> was full of fine and subtle
qualities of drawing, the <i>Scherzo in Blue</i> [Miss Waller] was the sketch
of a scarecrow in a blue dress without form and void. It is very difficult
to believe that Mr. Whistler is not openly laughing at us when he holds
up before us such a piece as this. His counterpart in Paris, the eccentric
M. Manet, has at least more sincerity than to exhibit his work in such
an imperfect condition."</p>

<p>But Whistler now had defenders. An "Art Student" wrote the
next day to the <i>Pall Mall</i> to point out that "at the private, and therefore,
presumably, the Press, view, <i>The Blue Girl</i> was seen in an unfinished
state, having been sent there merely to take up its space on the
wall. It was removed immediately, and has been since finished. Had
the critic seen it since he would hardly have called it without form and
void. The want of artistic sincerity is certainly the last charge that
can be brought against a man who has followed his artistic intention
with such admirable and unswerving singleness of purpose."</p>

<p>From this time onward Whistler no longer fought his battles
alone.</p>

<p>Eighteen eighty-two was the year of <i>The Paddon Papers</i>. Mr. Cole
noted in his diary: "<i>September 24.</i> To Jimmy's. He lent me proof
of his Paddon and Howell correspondence. Amusing, but too
personal for general interest." We agree with Mr. Cole. There were
complications of no importance with Howell, in which Paddon, a
diamond merchant, figured, and complications over a Chinese cabinet
which Mr. Morse bought from Whistler when he moved from No. 2
Lindsey Row. For long Mr. Morse had only the lower part, while
Howell kept the top. Whistler, who thought nothing concerning him
trivial, published this correspondence in a pamphlet, called <i>The Paddon
Papers: The Owl and the Cabinet</i>, interesting now only because it is
rare and because it was the end of all relations between himself and
Howell.</p>

<p>In the early winter of 1883 Whistler gave the second exhibition
of his Venetian etchings at the Fine Art Society's. The prints,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
fifty-one in number, included several London subjects. He decorated
the gallery in white and yellow. The wall was white with
yellow hangings, the floor was covered with pale yellow matting
and the couches with pale yellow serge. The cane-bottomed chairs
were painted yellow. There were yellow flowers in yellow pots, a
white and yellow livery for the attendant, and white and yellow
Butterflies for his friends. At the private view Whistler wore yellow
socks just showing above his shoes, and the assistants wore yellow
neckties. He prepared the catalogue; the brown paper cover, form,
and size now established. He printed after each number a quotation
from the critics of the past, and on the title-page, "Out of their own
mouths shall ye judge them." A friend who looked over the proofs
for him writes us:</p>

<p>"We came to 'there is merit in them, and I do not wish to understand
it.' [A quotation from the article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
which Sir Frederick Wedmore must wish could be forgotten.] Jimmy
yelled with joy, and thanked the printer for his intelligent misreading
of <i>understate</i>. 'I think we will let that stand as it is,' he said. I was
amused at the private view to see him discussing the question with
Wedmore, who, naturally, did not think it quite fair."</p>

<p>Before the show opened it was, Whistler told us, "Well, you know, a
source of constant anxiety to everybody and of fun to me. On the
ladder, when I was hanging the prints, I could hear whispers: no
one would be able to see the etchings! And then I would laugh, 'Dear
me, of course not! that's all right. In an exhibition of etchings
the etchings are the last things people come to see!' And then
there was the private view, and I had my box of wonderful little
Butterflies, and I distributed them only among the select few, so that,
naturally, everybody was eager to be decorated. And when the
crowd was greatest Royalty appeared, quite unprecedented at a private
view, and the crowd was hustled into another room while the Prince
and Princess of Wales went round the gallery, looking at everything,
the Prince chuckling over the catalogue. 'I say, Mr. Whistler, what
is this?' he asked when he came to the <i>Nocturne&mdash;Palaces</i>. 'I am
afraid you are very malicious, Mr. Whistler,' the Princess said."</p>

<p>Those who received the little Butterflies thought them charming.
Mrs. Marzetti writes us:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a few treasures which I guard most jealously; one is the
golden Butterfly that he made us wear at the private view of his exhibition
in Bond Street, in the original little card box in which he sent
them (three I think) to mother, with a message written on the lid,
and signed with his Butterfly."</p>

<p>The public laughed. They thought the Butterflies added to the
screaming farce, the foppery of the whole thing. The attendant in
yellow and white livery was called the poached egg. The catalogue was
worse. Poor Wedmore and the others could hardly like to have their
blunders and blindness immortalised. Most of them made the best of it
by refusing to see in him anything but the jester. His humour was
compared to Mark Twain's, and he to Barnum, and the show was "excruciatingly
agreeable." Some honestly thought his work rubbish, and
found his last little joke dull without being cheap. Their ridicule
has become ridiculous. As for Whistler's etchings, the price of the
series of <i>Twelve</i>, as of the <i>Twenty-Six</i> issued a year or so later in which
many of these prints were published, was fifty guineas; on May 27,
1908, the single print <i>Nocturne&mdash;Palaces</i> sold in Paris for one hundred
and sixty-eight guineas, and we have been offered two hundred pounds
for our <i>Traghetto</i>. The etchings were also shown in decorated rooms
in Boston and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>For the exhibitions of 1883 he had no new work, but sent two earlier
Nocturnes to the Grosvenor and to the <i>Salon</i> the <i>Mother</i>, and was
awarded a third-class medal, the only recompense he ever received
at the <i>Salon</i>. In the winter of 1883-84 he worked a great deal out
of doors, spending many weeks at St. Ives, Cornwall. He took no
interest in landscape; "there were too many trees in the country,"
he said. But he loved the sea, from the days of <i>The Blue Wave</i> at
Biarritz and <i>The Shores of Brittany</i> until one of the last summers when
he painted at Domburg, in Holland. The Cornish sketches were sent
to his show of <i>Notes, Harmonies, Nocturnes</i>, at Dowdeswell's Gallery
in May 1884, the first exhibition in which he included many water-colours.
The medium had been difficult to him; now he was its
master. He used it to record subjects as characteristic of London
as the subject of his pastels were of Venice. There were also studies
and sketches in Holland, for he was always running about again. The
interest of the catalogue was in the preface, <i>L'Envoie</i> he called it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and was so laughed at not only for the place he gave it, but for the
spelling, that he searched the dictionaries, and then declared, we cannot
say with what authority, that <i>envoie</i> means some sort of snake. "Ha
ha! that's it! Venom!" he said. The <i>Envoie</i>, without his explanation,
is interesting, for it consists of the <i>Propositions No. 2</i>, which have
become famous: that a picture is finished when all traces of the means
that produced it have disappeared; that industry in art is a necessity,
not a virtue; that the work of the master reeks not of the sweat of the
brow; that the masterpiece should appear as the flower of the painter,
perfect in its bud as in its bloom. He decorated the gallery: delicate
rose on the walls, white dado, white chairs, and pale azaleas in rose-flushed
jars. The Butterfly, tinted in rose, was on the card of invitation.
The <i>Arrangement in Flesh Colour and Grey</i> was as little
appreciated as the <i>Yellow and White</i> in 1883; to the critics it was a
new affectation.</p>

<p>There were signs of appreciation when, in 1884, Whistler sent
the <i>Carlyle</i> to the Loan Exhibition of Scottish National Portraits
at Edinburgh, where it created an impression. There had been
attempts to sell the picture. M. Duret tried to interest an Irish
collector, who, however, did not dare to buy it. It was offered to
Mr. Scharfe, director of the British National Portrait Gallery, who
not only refused to consider the offer, but laughed at the idea that
"such work should pass for painting." The first endeavour to secure
it for a national collection came from George R. Halkett, who urged
its purchase for the Scottish National Gallery in the <i>Scotsman</i> (October
6, 1884). He was supported by Mr. William Hole in a letter published
the following day.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the subscription paper disclaimed approval of
Whistler's art and theories on the part of subscribers. Whistler,
indignant, telegraphed to Edinburgh: "The price of the <i>Carlyle</i> has
advanced to one thousand guineas. Dinna ye hear the bagpipes?"
The price he had asked was four hundred, and this ended the negotiations.</p>

<p>Why about this time Whistler should have become involved in a
Church Congress in the Lake Country, unless he was coming from
or going to Scotland, we never have been able to explain. He told
us about it years later, and he seemed no less amazed than we. J.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
was just about to start for the Lakes, and Whistler was reminded of
his excursion there. We give the note made at the time:</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday</i>, <i>September</i> 16 (1900). Whistler dined, and Agnes
Repplier&mdash;not a successful combination. The dinner dragged until
E. J. Sullivan happened to come in, and Whistler woke up, and, all
of a sudden, we hardly know how, he was plunged into the midst of
the Lake Country and a Church Congress, travelling third class with
the clergy and their families, eating jam and strange meals with
quantities of tea, and visiting the Rev. Mr. Green in his prison, shut
up by his bishop for burning candles, and altogether the hero and
important person he would never be on coming out. An amazing
story, but what Whistler was doing in the Lakes with the clergy he
did not appear to know; the story was enough."</p>

<p>The only result of the expedition was the etching done in Cumberland,
and his impression of the unpicturesqueness of the Lakes: the
mountains "were all little round hills with little round trees out of
a Noah's Ark." What he thought of great mountain forms we do not
know for, save on the trip to Valparaiso and going to Italy, he never
saw them. Yet the lines of the coast in the <i>Crépuscule</i> show that he
could render mountains. But, as he said, the mountains of Cumberland
are only little round hills. At the end of his life he saw the mountains
of Corsica, Gibraltar, and Tangier, but there is no record.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV: AMONG FRIENDS.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-ONE TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-SEVEN.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the summer of 1884 that J. met Whistler. Up to this time
we have had to rely upon what Whistler and those who knew him
have told us. Henceforward we write from our own knowledge.</p>

<p>This is J.'s story of the meeting: "I first saw Whistler July 13,
1884. I had been asked by Mr. Gilder, editor of the <i>Century Magazine</i>,
to make the illustrations for a series of articles on <i>Old Chelsea</i> by Dr.
B. E. Martin, and Mr. Drake, the art editor, suggested that if I could
get Whistler to etch, draw, or paint something in Chelsea for the
<i>Century</i>, the <i>Century</i> would be very glad to have it. His water-colours
and pastels were being shown at Dowdeswell's&mdash;<i>Notes, Harmonies,
</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<i>Nocturnes</i>&mdash;and there his address was given me: No. 13 Tite
Street.</p>

<p>"The house did not strike me, I only remember the man and his
work. I knocked, the door was slightly opened, and I handed in
my letter from Mr. Gilder. I was left in the street. Then the door
was opened wide, and Whistler asked me in. He was all in white,
his waistcoat had long sleeves, and every minute it seemed as if he
must begin to juggle with glasses. For to be honest, my first impression
was of a bar-keeper strayed from a Philadelphia saloon into a Chelsea
studio. Never had I seen such thick, black, curling hair. But in
the midst was the white lock, and keen, brilliant eyes flashed at me
from under the thick, bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"At the end of the hall into which he took me was a shadowy
passage, then some steps, a light room beyond, and on an easel the
portrait of a little man with a violin, the <i>Sarasate</i>, that had never
been seen outside the studio. Whistler stopped me in the passage
and asked me what I thought of the picture. I cannot recall his words.
I was too overwhelmed by the dignity of the portrait to remember
what he said.</p>

<p>"Later on he brought out <i>The Falling Rocket</i>. 'Well now, what
do you think of that? What is it?'</p>

<p>"I said fireworks, and I supposed one of the Cremorne pictures.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you do, do you? Isn't it amazing? Bring tots, idiots,
imbeciles, blind men, children, anything but the Islander, and they
know; even you, who stole the name of my <i>Little Venice</i>.'</p>

<p>"This referred to an etching of mine which had been published
under the title of <i>Little Venice</i>. Why Whistler did not resent this
always or let it interfere with our friendship later, I do not know,
for Mr. Keppel has told me he felt bitterly about it at the time.</p>

<p>"Whistler also showed me some of his pastels. And he talked,
and I forget completely what he said until, finally, I suggested why
I had come, for I did not think there was any greater honour than
to see one's work in the pages of the <i>Century</i>. There was some excuse
delightfully made. Then he called to someone who appeared from a
corner. And Whistler said to him, 'Here's a chance for you. But
you will do these things.' And that was my introduction to Mr.
Mortimer Menpes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"This was not what I had bargained for, and I said promptly,
'Mr. Whistler, I came here to ask you to let us have some drawings
of Chelsea. If you cannot, why, I'll do them myself.'</p>

<p>"'Stay and lunch,' Whistler said, and there was lunch, a wonderful
curry, in a bright dining-room&mdash;a yellow and blue room. Later on
he took me down to the Embankment, and, though it seemed so little
like him, showed me the Carlyle statue and Turner's house. He pointed
out his own houses in Lindsey Row, and told me of a photographer
who had reproduced all his pictures and photographed old Chelsea.
I remember, too, asking Whistler about the Thames plates, and his
telling me they were all done on the spot. And then he drove me in
a cab to Piccadilly, and asked me to come and see him again.</p>

<p>"The next Sunday I went with Mr. Stephen Parrish to Haden's,
in Hertford Street. We were taken to the top storey, where Haden
was working on the mezzotint of the <i>Breaking up of the Agamemnon</i>.
I asked him&mdash;I must have almost paralysed him&mdash;what he thought
of Whistler, and he told me that if ever he had to sell either his collection
of Whistlers or of Rembrandts, the Rembrandts should go first. He
told that story often&mdash;and later they both went.&mdash;Downstairs, in a
sort of conservatory at the back of the dining-room, was a printing
press. Lady Haden joined us at lunch. So also did Mr. Hopkinson
Smith, resurrecting vast numbers of American 'chestnuts.' I can
recall that both Parrish and I found him in the way, and I can also
recall his getting us into such a state that, as we came down a street
leading into Piccadilly, Parrish vented his irritation on one of the
public goats which in those days acted both as scavengers and police
for London. As the goat put down his head to defend himself, Parrish
put up his umbrella, and the goat fled into the open door of a club.
What happened after that we did not wait to see.</p>

<p>"I saw Whistler only once again that summer. He was in Charing
Cross Station, in front of the bookstall. He wore a black frock-coat,
white trousers, patent leather shoes, top hat, and he was carrying,
the only time I ever saw it, the long cane. I did not want to speak
to him, and I liked his looks less than when I first met him.</p>

<p>"Early in the autumn of 1884 we went to Italy, and it was several
years after our return before I got really to know him, and to understand
that his appearance was to him merely a part of the 'joke of life.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI: AMONG FRIENDS.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-ONE TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-SEVEN CONTINUED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> said he could not afford to keep a friend, but he was never
without many. A photograph taken in his studio in 1881 shows him
the centre of a group, of whom the others are Julian and Waldo Story,
sons of W. W. Story; Frank Miles, a painter from whom great things
were expected; and the Hon. Frederick Lawless, a sculptor. In the
background is a little statuette everybody wanted to know the merit of,
explained one day by Whistler, "Well, you know&mdash;why, you can take it
up and&mdash;well, you can set it down!" Mr. Lawless writes us that
Whistler modelled the little figure, though we never heard that he
modelled anything, and Professor Lantéri says he never worked in the
round. Mr. Pennington suggests that the statuette was by Mr. Waldo
Story, but Mr. Lawless says:</p>

<p>"When Whistler lived in his London studio he often modelled
graceful statuettes, and one day he put up one on a vase, asking me to
photograph it. I said he must stand beside it. He said, 'But we must
make a group and all be photographed,' and that I was to call out to
his servant when to take the lid off the camera, and when to put it
back. I then developed the negative in his studio."</p>

<p>Mr. Francis James, often at 13 Tite Street, has many memories,
specially of one summer evening when Coquelin <i>aîné</i> and a large party
came to supper and Whistler kept them until dawn and then took them
to see the sun rise over the Thames, a play few had ever performed in.</p>

<p>For two or three years no one was more with Whistler than Sir
Rennell Rodd. He writes us:</p>

<p>"It was in '82, '83 that I saw most of him. Frank Miles, Waldo
and Julian Story, Walter Sickert, Harper Pennington, and, at one time,
Oscar Wilde, were constantly there. Jimmy, unlike many artists,
liked a <i>camarade</i> about the place while he was working, and talked and
laughed and raced about all the time, putting in the touches delicately,
after matured thought, with long brushes. There was a poor fellow
who had been a designer for Minton&mdash;but his head had given way
and he was already quite mad&mdash;used to be there day after day for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
months and draw innumerable sketches on scraps of brown paper, cartridge
boards, anything&mdash;often full of talent, but always mad. Well,
Jimmy humoured him and made his last weeks of liberty happy.
Eventually he had to be removed to an asylum, and died raving mad.
I used to help Whistler often in printing his etchings. It was very
laborious work. He would manipulate a plate for hours with the ball
of the thumb and the flat of the palm to get just the right superficial
ink left on it, while I damped the paper, which came out of old folio
volumes, the first and last sheets, with a fairly stiff brush. And often,
for a whole morning's work, only one or two prints were achieved which
satisfied his critical eye, and the rest would be destroyed. There was
a Venetian one which gave him infinite trouble in the printing.</p>

<p>"He was the kindest of men, though he was handy with his cane.
In any financial transaction he was scrupulously honourable, though
he never had much money at his disposal.</p>

<p>"We had great fun over the many correspondences and the catalogues
elaborated in those days in Tite Street.... He was demoniacal
in controversy, and the spirit of elfin mischief was developed in him
to the point of genius.... Pellegrini was much at Whistler's in
those days, and in a way the influence of Whistler was fatal to him. His
admiration was unbounded and he abandoned his art, in which, as
Jimmy used to say, 'he had taught all the others what none of them had
been able to learn,' and took to trying to paint portraits in Whistler's
manner without any success.</p>

<p>"One of the few modern painters I have ever heard him praise
was Albert Moore, and I am not sure that was not to some extent
due to a personal liking for the man. It always struck me his literary
judgments, if he ever happened to express any, were extraordinarily
sound and brilliant in summing up the merits or demerits of a writer.</p>

<p>"He had an extraordinary power of putting a man in his place.
I remember a breakfast which Waldo Story gave at Dieudonné's. Everyone
there had painted a picture, or written a book, or in some way outraged
the Philistine, with the exception of one young gentleman, whose
<i>raison d'être</i> there was not so apparent as were the height of his collars
and the glory of his attire. He nevertheless ventured to lay down the
law on certain matters which seemed beyond his province, and even
went so far as to combat some dictum of the master's, who, readjusting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
his eye-glass, looked pleasantly at him, and said, 'And whose son are
you?'"</p>

<p>For two or three years Oscar Wilde was so much with Whistler that
everyone who went to the studio found him there, just as everyone
who went into society saw them together. Wilde had come up from
Oxford not long before the Ruskin trial, with a reputation as a brilliant
undergraduate, winner of the Newdigate prize, and he now posed as
the apostle of "Beauty." Many a reputation is lost between Oxford
and London, but his was strengthened. Oscar's witty sayings were
repeated and his youth seemed to excuse his pose. Whistler impressed
him. At Oxford Wilde had followed Ruskin, and broken stones
on the road which was to lead the young to art; he had read with
Pater, he had accepted the teaching of Morris and Burne-Jones, and
their master Rossetti. But Ruskin was impossible to follow, Pater
was a recluse, Rossetti's health was broken, the prehistoric Fabians,
Morris and Burne-Jones, were the foci of a little group of their own.
When Wilde came to London Whistler was the focus of the world.
Whistler was sought out, Wilde tried to play up. In Tite Street blue
and white was used, not as a symbol of faith, but every day; flowers
bloomed, not as a pledge of "culture," but for their colour and form;
beauty was accepted as no discovery, but as the aim of art since the
first artist drew a line and saw that it was beautiful. Whistler knew all
this. Wilde fumbled with it.</p>

<p>Whistler was flattered by Wilde. He was looked upon as the world's
jester when Wilde fawned upon him. Other young men gathered
about Whistler had name and reputation to make. But Wilde's name
was in every man's mouth; he glittered with the glory of the work he
was to do. He was the most promising poet of his generation and he
was amusing. There was a charm in his personality. We remember
when we met him on his lecture tour in America, and hardly knew
whether the magnificence on the platform where, in velvet knickerbockers,
he faced with calmness rows of college boys each bearing a lily,
and stood with composure their collective emotion as he sipped a glass
of water, was more wonderful than his gaiety when we talked with him
afterwards. It has been said that he gave the best of himself in his
talk. If Whistler liked always to have a companion, his pleasure was
increased when he found someone as brilliant. Wilde spent hours in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the studio, he came to Whistler's Sunday breakfasts, he assisted at
Whistler's private views. Whistler went with him everywhere. There
were few functions at which they were not present. At receptions
the company divided into two groups, one round Whistler, the other
round Wilde. It was the fashion to compare them. To the world
that ran after them, that thought itself honoured, or notorious, by
their presence, they seemed inseparable.</p>

<p>The trouble began when Whistler discovered how small was Wilde's
knowledge of art; he could never endure anybody in the studio who did
not understand. Whistler wrote of Wilde as a man "with no more
sense of a picture than of the fit of a coat." <i>The Gentle Art</i> shows that
Whistler was furious with Wilde's borrowing from him. That Wilde
took his good where he found it is neither more nor less than what has
always been done&mdash;what Whistler did. But the genius, from the good
thus taken, evolves something of his own. Wilde was content to shine
personally and let the great things expected of him wait. When it
was a question of wit, there was no one to whom Wilde could go
except Whistler. It is all expressed in the old story: "I wish I had
said that, Whistler." "You will, Oscar, you will." In matters of
art Wilde had everything to learn from Whistler, who, though ever
generous, resented Wilde's preaching in the provinces the truths which
he had taught for years. This is all in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. "Oscar"
had "the courage of the opinions ... of others!" and again: "Oscar
went forth as my St. John, but, forgetting that humility should be his
chief characteristic and unable to withstand the unaccustomed respect
with which his utterances were received, he not only trifled with my
shoe, but bolted with the latchet!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cole, in 1884, noted in his diary that Whistler "was strong
on Oscar Wilde's notions of art which he derived from him (Jimmy)."
Mr. Herbert Vivian tells the story of a dinner given by Whistler after
Wilde had been lecturing:</p>

<p>"'Now, Oscar, tell us what you said to them,' Whistler kept insisting,
and Wilde had to repeat all the phrases, while Whistler rose and
made solemn bows, with his hand across his breast, in mock acceptance
of his guests' applause.... The cruel part of the plagiarism lay in the
fact that, when Whistler published his <i>Ten O'Clock</i>, many people
thought it had all been taken from Wilde's lecture."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Whistler grew more and more exasperated by the use Wilde made
of him. Their intimacy was closest in the early eighties when Whistler
was bewildering the world deliberately; Wilde copied him clumsily.
The world, that did not know them, mistook one for the other and
thought Whistler as much an æsthete as Wilde. When <i>Patience</i> was
produced, and when it was revived a few years ago, Bunthorne, who
was Wilde, appeared with Whistler's black curls and white lock, moustache,
tuft, eye-glass, and laughed with Whistler's "Ha ha!" Whistler,
seeing Wilde in a Polish cap and "green overcoat befrogged and wonderfully
befurred," desired him to "restore those things to Nathan's,
and never again let me find you masquerading the streets of my Chelsea
in the combined costumes of Kossuth and Mr. Mantalini!" To be
in danger of losing his pose before the world was bad enough, but to
be mistaken for another man who rendered him ridiculous was worse.
No one has summed up the position better than the <i>Times</i> in a notice
of Wilde's <i>Collected Works</i>:</p>

<p>"With a mind not a jot less keen than Whistler's, he had none
of the conviction, the high faith, for which Whistler found it worth
while to defy the crowd. Wilde had poses to attract the crowd.
And the difference was this, that while Whistler was a prophet who
liked to play Pierrot, Wilde grew into a Pierrot who liked to play the
prophet."</p>

<p>If Whistler ever played Pierrot, it was with a purpose. Where art
was concerned he was serious. Wilde was serious about nothing. His
two topics were "self and art," and his interest in both was part of
his bid for notoriety. He might jest about himself, but flippancy, if
art was his subject, was to Whistler a crime. The only way he showed
his resentment was by refusing to take Wilde seriously about anything.
Even when Wilde was married, he was not allowed to forget, for
Whistler telegraphed to the church, "Fear I may not be able to reach
you in time for the ceremony. Don't wait." Later, in Paris, he called
Wilde "Oscar, <i>bourgeois malgré lui</i>," a witticism none could appreciate
better than the Parisians. As soon as he began to make a jest of Wilde
he ended the companionship to which, while it lasted, London society
owed much gaiety.</p>

<p>The relation between Whistler and artists now coming to the
studio was less that of friends than of Master and Followers, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
called themselves. He was forty-six when he returned from Venice,
and there were few men of the new generation who shared none of the
doubts of his contemporaries, but believed in him. The devotion of
this group became infatuation. They were ready to do anything for
him. Families became estranged and engagements were broken off
because of him. They fought his battles; ran his errands, spied
out the land for him; published his letters, and read them to
everybody. They formed a court about him. They exaggerated everything,
even their devotion, and became caricatures of him, as excessive
in imitation as in devotion. He denied the right of any, save the
artist, to speak authoritatively of art; they started a club to train the
classes&mdash;Princes, Prime Ministers, Patrons, Ambassadors, Members
of Parliament&mdash;to blind faith in Master and Followers. Whistler
mixed masses of colours on the palette, keeping them under water in
saucers. The Followers mixed theirs in vegetable dishes and kept
them in milk-cans, labelled Floor, Face, Hair, Lips. He had a table-palette;
they adopted it, but added hooks to hang their cans of
paint on. He used his paint very liquid&mdash;the "sauce" of the
Nocturnes; they used such quantities of medium that as much went
on the floor as on the canvas, and, before a picture was blocked in,
they were wading in liquid masterpieces. Many of his brushes were
large; they worked with whitewash brushes. They copied his personal
peculiarities. One evening at a dinner when he wore a white waistcoat
and all the buttons, because of the laundress, came out, a
Follower, seeing it buttonless, hurried from the room, and returned
with his bulging, sure that he was in the movement.</p>

<p>Whistler accepted their devotion, and, finding them willing to
squander their time, monopolised it. There was plenty for everybody
to do in the studio. If they complained that he took advantage of
them, he proved to them that the fault was theirs. Mr. Menpes
writes:</p>

<p>"We seldom asked Whistler questions about his work.... If we
had, he would have been sure to say, 'Pshaw! You must be occupied
with the Master, not with yourselves. There is plenty to be done.'
If there was not, Whistler would always make a task for you&mdash;a picture
to be taken into Dowdeswells', or a copper plate to have a ground put
on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>No one respected the work of others more than Whistler. But
if others did not respect it themselves and made him a present of their
time he did not refuse. If he allowed the Followers to accompany
him in his little journeys, it was because they were so eager. When
he went with Walter Sickert and Mortimer Menpes to St. Ives, in the
winter of 1883-84, they were up at six o'clock because it pleased him;
they dared not eat till he rang the bell. They prepared his panels, mixed
his colours, cleaned his brushes, taking a day off for fishing if Whistler
chose, abjuring sentiment if he objected. Whistler saw the humour in
their attitude and was the more exacting. The Followers were not
allowed their own opinions. Once, when Walter Sickert ventured to
praise Leighton's <i>Harvest Moon</i> at the Manchester Art Treasures
Exhibition, Whistler, hearing of it, telegraphed: "The Harvest Moon
rises over Hampstead [where Sickert lived], and the cocks of Chelsea
crow." The Followers, however, knew that if they were of use to
Whistler, he was of infinitely more use to them, and that submission
to his rule and exposure to his wit were a small price to pay. Mr.
Sickert tells another story. He and Whistler were once printing etchings
together, when the former dropped a copper plate. "How like you!"
said Whistler. Five minutes afterwards the improbable happened.
Whistler, who was never clumsy, dropped one himself. There was a
pause. "How unlike me!" was his remark.</p>

<p>Mr. Menpes, who, in <i>Whistler as I Knew Him</i>, makes more of the
follies than the privileges of the Followers, cannot ignore their debt.
They worked for him not only in the studio, but in the street, hunting
with him for little shops, corners and models, painting at his side,
walking home with him after dinner or supper at the club, learning
from him to observe and memorise the night. To them he was full
of kindliness, when to the world he often seemed insolent and audacious,
and after his death&mdash;even before&mdash;some denied him. Later Whistler
said that the Followers were there in the studio; yes, but they never
painted there; they were kept well in the background.</p>

<p>American artists, in London or passing through, began to make their
way to the studio. Otto Bacher records in 1883 Whistler's friendliness,
the pictures in the studio, their dinners together. In 1885 Mr. John
W. Alexander came, commissioned by the <i>Century</i> to make a drawing
of him for a series of portraits. Whistler posed for a little while, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
unwillingly, and criticised the drawing so severely that Mr. Alexander
tore it up. After that, he says, Whistler posed like a lamb. Mr.
Harper Pennington has written for us his reminiscences of those years:</p>

<p>"... Whistler was more than kind to me. Through him came
everything. He introduced me right and left, and called me 'pupil';
took me about to picture shows and pointed out the good and bad. I
remember my astonishment the first occasion of his giving unstinted
praise to modern work, on which he seldom lavished positives. It was
at the Royal Academy before one of those interiors of Orchardson's.
Well, he stood in front of the canvas, his hat almost on his nose, his
'tuft' sticking straight out as it did when he would catch his nether
lip between his teeth, and, presently, a long forefinger went out and
circled round a bit of yellow drapery, 'It would have been nice to
have painted that,' he said, as if he thought aloud.</p>

<p>"Another day we rushed to the National Gallery&mdash;'just to get the
taste out of our mouths,' he said&mdash;after a couple of hours' wandering
in the Royal Academy wilderness of Hardy Annual Horrors. Whistler
went at once to almost <i>smell</i> the Canalettos, while I went across the
Gallery, attracted by the <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>. It was my first sight of
them. Up to that day I had supposed that what I was told and had
read of Hogarth was the truth&mdash;the silly rubbish about his being <i>only</i>
a caricaturist, so that when confronted with those marvels of technical
quality, I fairly gasped for breath, and then hurried over to where
Whistler had his nose against the largest Canaletto, seized his arm,
and said hurriedly, 'Come over here.' 'What's the matter?' said he,
turning round. 'Why! Hogarth! He was a great painter!' 'Sh&mdash;sh!'
said he (pretending he was afraid that someone would overhear
us). 'Sh&mdash;sh! Yes, I <i>know</i> it, ... <i>but don't you tell 'em</i>!' Later,
Hogarth was thoroughly discussed and his qualities pointed out with
that incisive manner which one had to be familiar with to understand.</p>

<p>"Whistler was reasonable enough and preferred a joke to a battle
any day. Often he came to me in the King's Road, breathing vengeance
against this or that person, but when he went away it was <i>invariably</i>
with a <i>fin sourire</i> and one of his little notes. His clairvoyance in the
matter of two notes to Leighton was made manifest at my writing-table.
The P.R.A. wrote a lame explanation to Whistler's first query as to
why he had not been invited to the Academy <i>soirée</i>, as President of the
R.S.B.A., <i>ex-officio</i>, or as Whistler. He came into my room one
morning early&mdash;before I, sluggard, was awake!&mdash;and read to me an
outline of a note he meant to write, and then wrote it with grace
of diction and dainty composition, and the pretty balanced Butterfly
for signature. When that was done, he turned to me (I was dressing
then) and said: 'Now, Har-r-rpur-r-r.' (He liked to burr those r's
in 'down-east' fashion.) 'Now, Har-r-rpur-r-r, I know Leighton,
he will <i>fumble</i> this. He will answer so-and-so' (describing the answer
Leighton actually sent), 'and then I've got him!' He chuckled, wrote
another note&mdash;the retort to Leighton's unwritten answer to Whistler's
not yet posted first note&mdash;which he read to me. That retort was sent
almost verbatim, only one slight change made necessary by a turn of
phrase in Leighton's weak apology! That <i>was</i> 'Amazing.' His anger
soon burnt out&mdash;the jest <i>would</i> come&mdash;and the whole thing boiled
itself down in the <i>World</i>, or a line to 'Labby.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII: THE STUDIO IN THE FULHAM ROAD.<br />
THE YEARS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-FIVE TO EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-SEVEN.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1885 Whistler moved from Tite Street to 454 Fulham Road. A
shabby gate opened on a shabby lane leading to studios, one of which
was his. Here Lady Archibald Campbell's and M. Duret's portraits
were finished. Whistler was living at the time with Maud in a little
house close by, since pulled down, which he called the "Pink Palace,"
having painted it himself. He was again hard up, and M. Duret,
coming to dinner, would buy a good part of it on the way down and
arrive, his pockets bulging with bottles and fruit and cake. Before
long Whistler left the "Pink Palace" for the Vale, Chelsea&mdash;"an
amazing place, you might be in the heart of the country, and there,
two steps away, is the King's Road." It was the first house on the
right beyond the iron gates, now demolished. But the whole place has
gone.</p>

<p>In the <i>Court and Society Review</i> (July 1, 1886) Mr. Malcolm C.
Salaman described the Fulham Road studio and the work in progress:</p>

<p>"The whitewashed walls, the wooden rafters, which partly form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
a loft for the stowing away of canvases, the vast space unencumbered
by furniture, and the large table-palette, all give the appearance of
the working place.... Mr. Whistler is not so feeble as to aim at
theatrical effects in his costume. In the black clothes of ordinary
wear, straight from the street, he stands at his easel. To those
accustomed to studios the completeness of the arrangement ... in
accordance with the scheme of the picture that is in progress is striking,
as striking indeed as the personality of the artist. His whole body
seems instinct with energy and enthusiasm, his face lit up with flashes
of quick and strong thought, as that of a man who sees with his brains
as well as with his eyes....</p>

<p>"A word, by the way, about Mr. Whistler's palette. As I saw it
the other day, the colours were arranged almost with the appearance
of a picture. In the centre was white and on one side were the various
reds leading up to black, while on the other side were the yellows
leading up to blue....</p>

<p>"And now a few words about some of the pictures which the
master had almost ready for exhibition: A full-length figure of a girl
in out-door black dress, with a fur cape and a hat trimmed with
flowers. She stands against a dark background, and she <i>lives</i> in her
frame. A full-length portrait of Mr. Walter Sickert, a favourite
pupil of Mr. Whistler's and one of his cleverest disciples. He is in
evening dress, and stands against a dark wall. This is a picture that
Velasquez himself would have delighted in. [It has vanished.] A
full-length portrait of a man with a Spanish-looking head, painted
in a manner that is surely of the greatest. [Perhaps the portrait of
Chase or of Eldon; both have disappeared.]... A superb portrait
of Mrs. Godwin will rank among Mr. Whistler's <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>. The
lady stands in an ample red cloak over a black dress, against red
draperies, and in her bonnet is a red plume. Her hands rest on her
hips, and her attitude is singularly vivacious. This picture has been
painted in artificial light, as has also another of a lady seated in a
graceful attitude, with one hand leaning over the back of a chair, while
the other holds a fan. She wears a white evening dress, and is seen
against a light background. [A picture we cannot identify.] Besides
these Mr. Whistler showed me sketches of various groups of several
girls on the seashore ... [<i>The Six Projects</i>] and a sketch of <i>Venus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
lovely in colour and design, the nude figure standing close to the sea,
with delicate gauze draperies lightly lifted by the breeze. The studio
is full of canvases and pictures in more or less advanced stages, and
on one of the walls hang a number of pastel studies of nude and partially
draped female figures. A portrait-sketch in black chalk of Mr. Whistler
by M. Rajon also hangs on the wall."</p>

<p>The <i>Further Proposition</i>, which was quoted by Mr. Salaman, can be
read in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. It is Whistler's statement that a figure should
keep well within the frame, and that flesh should be painted according
to the light in which it is seen: the answer to the objection often
made to his portraits because the "flesh was low in tone." A year
later it was reprinted in the <i>Art Journal</i> (April 1887) by Mr. Walter
Dowdeswell, whose article was the first appreciation of Whistler in
an important English magazine. Whistler, knowing the value of
what he wrote, meant that his writings should be preserved, and he
gave to Mr. Dowdeswell for publication the reply which he had made
twenty years earlier to Hamerton's criticism of the <i>Symphony in White,
No. III.</i>, but which was not then printed because the <i>Saturday Review</i>,
where the criticism appeared, did not publish correspondence. Mr.
Dowdeswell, describing the studio, adds a few details omitted by
Mr. Salaman: "The <i>soupçon</i> of yellow in the rugs and matting; a
table covered with old Nankin china; a crowd of canvases at the
further end, and, pinned upon the wall on the right, a number of
exquisite little notes of colour, and drawings of figures from life, in
pastels, on brown paper."</p>

<p>Mr. E. J. Horniman, who had a studio near by, tells us that he often
saw on the roof of the omnibus stable, just behind it, pictures put out to
dry.</p>

<p>Many who visited the studio were surprised to find Whistler
working in white. He sometimes wore a white jacket; sometimes
took off his coat and waistcoat. He was as fastidious with his
work as with his dress. He could not endure a slovenly palette, or
brushes and colours in disorder, though the palette had a raised edge
to keep the colour off his sleeve. Unfortunately, after his wife's death
he ruined the two portraits of himself in the white painting jacket,
which he never exhibited, by changing the white jacket to a black coat.</p>

<p>Other reminiscences of Fulham Road we have from William M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Chase, who came to London in 1885, with a suggestion that he and
Whistler should paint each other; also, that Whistler should go back
to America and open a school. "Well, you know, that anyway will
be all right, Colonel," as Whistler called Chase. "Of course, everybody
will receive me; tug-boats will come down the Bay; it will be
perfect!" He thought so seriously of going, that he hesitated to
send to the London galleries work he would want for America.</p>

<p>The two portraits were begun. Whistler painted a full-length
of Chase, in frock-coat and top-hat, a cane held jauntily across his
legs. As he wrote afterwards, in a letter included in <i>The Gentle Art</i>,
"I, who was charming, made him beautiful on canvas, the Masher
of the Avenues." Whistler was delighted with what he had done:</p>

<p>"Look at this, Colonel! Look at this; did you ever see anything
finer?"</p>

<p>"It's meek or modest, they'll have to put on your tombstone!"</p>

<p>"Say 'and' not 'or'&mdash;meek and modest! H'm!&mdash;well, you know,
splendid, Chase!"</p>

<p>Chase remembers an evening when they were to dine out, and
Whistler had to go home to dress, and it was almost the hour before he
ventured to remind him. Then Whistler was astonished:</p>

<p>"What, Chase, you can think of dinner and time when we are
doing such beautiful things? Stay where you are, and they will be
glad to see me whenever I come."</p>

<p>Everybody who has been with him in the studio knows how difficult
it was for him to stop when he was absorbed in his work. Mr. Pennington
says: "Whistler's habit of painting long after the hour when
anybody could distinguish gradations of light and colour was the
cause of much unnecessary repainting and many disappointments,
for after leaving a canvas that seemed exquisite in the dusk of the
falling night, he would return to it in the glare of the next morning
and find unexpected effects that had been concealed by the twilight.
Whistler never learned to hold his hand when daylight waned. The
fascination of <i>seeming</i> to have caught the values led him far into the
deceiving shades of night with often disastrous results."</p>

<p>Whistler's portrait of Chase has vanished with many another.
Chase painted Whistler also in frock-coat, without a hat, holding
the long cane, against a yellow wall, and his portrait remains. Chase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
intended stopping a short time in London as he passed on to Madrid.
But he found Whistler so delightful that his visit to Spain was put
off. He has told many incidents of these months spent with Whistler
in a lecture delivered in the United States, and in an article in the
<i>Century</i>. A lecturer, no doubt, must adapt himself to his audience,
and Chase has dwelt principally on Whistler, the man&mdash;Whistler,
the dandy; Whistler, the fantastic, designing, for the tour in America,
a white hansom with yellow reins and a white and yellow livery for
the nigger driver; Whistler, the traveller. They went together to
Belgium and Holland. They stopped at Antwerp and saw the International
Exhibition. Whistler said to us once that he could never be
ill-natured, only wicked, and this was one of the occasions when he
was wicked. In the gallery he refused to look at any pictures except
those that told stories, asking Chase if the mouse would really scare
the cat or the baby swallow the mustard-pot. The first interest he
showed was in the work of Alfred Stevens. Before it he stood long;
at last, with his little finger pointing to a passage in the small canvas,
"H'm, Colonel! you know one would not mind having painted
that!" Chase grew nervous as they approached the wall devoted
to Bastien-Lepage, whom he admired, and he decided to leave Whistler.
But Whistler would not hear of it. "I'll say only one word, Chase,"
he promised. Then they came to the Bastiens, "H'm, h'm, Colonel,
the one word&mdash;School!" On the journey from Antwerp to Amsterdam
two Germans were in the train: "Well, you know, Colonel, if the
Almighty ever made a mistake it was when he created the German!"
Whistler said at the end of a few minutes. Chase told him that if
he could speak German he might understand their interesting talk.
Whistler answered in fluent German and talked nothing else, until,
at Haarlem, Chase could endure it no longer and left. Whistler leaned
out of the window as the train started, "Think it over, Chase, and
to-morrow morning you will come on to Amsterdam, and you'll tell
me that I'm right about the Germans!"</p>

<p>One incident not told in print by Chase is that while in London
he was the owner of the <i>Mother</i>. An American had given him money
to buy pictures, and when he found that the <i>Mother</i> was to be had
from Mr. Graves for one hundred pounds he bought it, but first was
referred to Whistler by Mr. Graves. Whistler, delighted to learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
that he could control the pictures deposited with the Pall Mall firm,
agreed to everything, but the agreement, was settled the day before
starting for Antwerp, and when Chase got the money from his bankers
and hurried to the Graves Gallery it was closed, and he gave the cheque
to Whistler. The picture was his, but only during the time of Whistler's
absence from London, for on his return Whistler could not bear to
part with it and promptly sent the cheque back to Chase&mdash;or it may be
that the trip with Chase helped him to change his mind.</p>

<p>All this is characteristic, but it would be interesting to hear less
of his play and more of his work from Chase, who gives only a glimpse
of Whistler the artist, and then in lighter moods. He tells of one
occasion when an American wanted to buy some etchings, and they
were to lunch with him in the City to arrange the matter. Taking
a hansom, late of course, they passed a grocer's where Whistler stopped
the driver: "Well, Chase, what do you think? If I get him to move
the box of oranges? What?" And then, still later, they drove on.
Another time, Chase expressed surprise at Whistler's refusing to deliver
a picture to the lady who had bought it. But Whistler explained:</p>

<p>"You know, Chase, the people don't really want anything beautiful.
They fill a room by chance with beautiful things, and some little
trumpery something over the mantelpiece gives the whole damned
show away. And if they pay a hundred pounds or so for a picture,
they think it belongs to them. Well&mdash;why&mdash;it should only be theirs
for a while; hung on their walls that they may rejoice in it and then
returned." Once, it is said, a lady drove up to the studio and told
him: "I have bought one of your pictures, it is beautiful, but as it
is always at exhibitions I never see it. But I'm told you have it."
"Dear lady," said Whistler, "you have been misinformed, it is not
here." And she drove away. Later he found it: "H'm, she was
right about one thing, it is beautiful. But because she's paid hundreds
of pounds for it, she thinks she ought to have it all the time. She's
lucky if she gets it now and then."</p>

<p>It must be admitted that it is not easy from any standpoint to
write of Whistler during the years that followed his return from
Venice. The decade between 1880 and 1890 is the fullest of his full
life. It was during these ten years that he opened his "one man"
shows amidst jeers, and closed them with success. It was during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
these ten years that he conquered society, though society never realised
it. It was during these ten years that, to make himself known, he
became in the streets of London the observed of all observers, developing
extraordinary costumes, attracting to himself the attention he wanted
to attract. It was during these ten years that he began to wrap himself
in mystery, as Degas said of him, and then go off and get photographed,
when, as Degas also said, he acted as if he had no genius: but mystery
and pose were part of the armour he put on to protect himself from,
and draw to himself, a foolish public. It was during these ten years
that he invented the Followers&mdash;and got rid of them; that he flitted
from house to house, from studio to studio, and through England,
France, Belgium, and Holland, until it is impossible to keep pace
with him; that he captured the Press, though it is still unconscious
of its capture; that he concentrated the interest of England, of the
whole world upon him, with one object in view&mdash;that is, to make
England, the whole world, look at his work. For, as he said, if he had
not made people look at it they never would have done so. They never
understood it, they hated it. They do not understand it to-day,
and they hate it the more because he has succeeded and they have failed
in their endeavours to ignore or ruin him. Even now that it is too
late, they are crawling from their graves and spitting at him, flinging
mud at his memory.</p>

<p>In these crowded years two events stand out with special prominence,
his <i>Ten O'Clock</i> and his invasion of the British Artists. One
states definitely his views on art; the other shows as definitely the
position he had attained among artists.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII: THE TEN O'CLOCK.<br /> THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-FOUR TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Into</span> <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> Whistler put all he had learned of art, all he
knew to be unchangeable and everlasting. Mr. W. C. Alexander has
told us that when he listened to <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> at Prince's Hall,
nothing in it was new to him; he had heard it for years from Whistler
over the dinner-table. The only new thing was Whistler's determination
to say in public what he had said in private. He was busy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
with this in the autumn and winter of 1884-85. He would come at
strange hours and read a page to Mr. Cole, in whose diary, from October
until February, note follows note of his visits:</p>

<p>"<i>October 24</i> (1884). Whistler to dine. We passed the evening
writing out his views on Ruskin, art, etc.</p>

<p>"<i>October 27.</i> Jimmy to dinner, continuing notes as to himself
and art.</p>

<p>"<i>October 28.</i> Writing out Whistler's notes for him.</p>

<p>"<i>October 29.</i> Jimmy to dine. Writing notes as to his opinions
on art matters, and discussing whether to offer them for publication to
<i>English Illustrated Magazine</i> edited by Comyns Carr, or to whom?"</p>

<p>Mr. G. A. Holmes, in his Chelsea house, was often roused by the
sharp ring and double-knock, followed by Whistler with a page or
paragraph for his approval. Mr. Menpes writes that "scores of times&mdash;I
might almost say hundreds of times&mdash;he paced up and down the
Embankment at night, repeating to me sentences from the marvellous
lecture." A marvellous story. During a few days' illness at his
brother's in Wimpole Street, where, when ill, he went, Mrs. Whistler
recalled him sitting, propped up by pillows, reading passages to the
doctor and herself.</p>

<p>His plan for an article in the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i> came to
nothing. In November 1884 Lord Powerscourt, Mr. Ludovici says
in the <i>Art Journal</i> (July 1906), invited Whistler to Ireland to distribute
prizes at an art school and speak to the students, and nothing was more
appropriate than the notes he had written down.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole records:</p>

<p>"<i>November 19</i> (1884). Whistler called and told us how he was
invited to Ireland, where he was sending some of his works, and would
lecture in Dublin."</p>

<p>The invitation came from the Dublin Sketching Club, which held
its exhibitions in Leinster Hall. Three other Americans&mdash;Sargent,
Julian Story, and Ralph Curtis&mdash;were invited. No such collection
of Whistler's work had been seen out of London. Mr. Booth Pearsall,
the honorary secretary, sends us this account:</p>

<p>"He was exceedingly generous to a club of strangers, lending them
twenty-five of his works. This collection included the <i>Mother</i>, <i>Lady
Meux</i>, <i>Carlyle</i>, a number of Nocturnes, and other oils, water-colours,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and pastels. The pictures had to be hung together in a group. As
I was so interested in them, with Mr. Whistler's permission, I had
them photographed. He never asked for rights or commission, but, in
the most gracious, generous way, gave us the permission to use the
negatives as we liked. The exhibition was hardly opened before the
critical music began, and in the papers and in conversation, a regular
tempest arose that was highly diverting to Mr. Whistler. He begged
me to send him everything said about the exhibition, and his letters
show he quite enjoyed all the ferment. The whole of Dublin was
convulsed, and many went to Molesworth Street to see the exhibition
who rarely went to see anything of the kind. Then a terrible convulsion
took place in the club: a group of members we had admitted,
who photographed, got together, and drew up resolutions, that never
again should such pictures be exhibited. None of these men could
even paint. The talent of the club replied by having Mr. Whistler
elected as hon. member, and it was carried, despite intense resistance.
I took an active part in all this. It was with a view to helping Mr.
Whistler that I did my best to have his <i>Ten O'Clock</i> given in Dublin.
He was at first disposed to come over, but other matters prevented,
and the matter dropped. During the time of the exhibition, I tried
my utmost to sell the pictures, and an offer was made by a friend
to purchase the <i>Mother</i> and the <i>Carlyle</i>, which seemed to promise well,
but ultimately stopped. I did induce the friend to purchase <i>Piccadilly</i>,
which had been No. 9, <i>Nocturne in Grey and Gold&mdash;Piccadilly</i> (water-colour),
in his exhibition in Bond Street that May [Dowdeswell's].
He was very much pleased indeed, and sent the Right Hon. Jonathan
Hogg, P.C., a receipt, greatly to Mr. Hogg's amusement, for an
impression was rife that he never did attend to business. I know
from friends, who knew Mr. Whistler, how much pleased he was,
not only with the purchase of his pictures, but with the commotion
that the exhibition caused."</p>

<p>Whistler did not give up the idea of a lecture. Archibald Forbes
heard him read, was impressed, and introduced him to Mrs. D'Oyly
Carte. She had managed a lecture tour for Forbes, now she agreed
to arrange an evening for Whistler. She told us of his attention
to detail. "The idea was absolutely his," she wrote us, "and all
I did was to see to the business arrangements. You can imagine how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
enthusiastic he was over it all, and how he made one enthusiastic too."
She was about to produce <i>The Mikado</i>, and, sure that he would find
her in her office at the Savoy Theatre, he would appear there every
evening to talk things over, or would send Mr. Walter Sickert with
a message. Whistler delighted in her office, a tiny room lit by a lamp
on her desk, making strange effects, but his only records of his many
visits are in the etchings, <i>Savoy Scaffolding</i> and <i>Miss Lenoir</i>, Mrs.
D'Oyly Carte's name before her marriage. Prince's Hall was taken.</p>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus058.png" alt="TEXT" width="600" height="387" />
</div>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p>Whistler suggested the hour. People were not to rush to him from
dinner as to the theatre; therefore ten was as early as one could expect
them, and the hour gave the name&mdash;<i>The Ten O'Clock</i>. He designed
the ticket, he had it enlarged into a poster, he chose the offices where
tickets should be sold. There was a rehearsal at Prince's Hall on
February 19 (1885), Mrs. D'Oyly Carte and some of the Followers
sitting in front to tell him if his voice carried. Whistler had his lecture
by heart, his delivery was excellent, he needed no coaching, only an
occasional warning to raise his voice. It was because he feared his
voice would not carry that he gave his nightly rehearsals on the
Embankment, Mr. Menpes says.</p>

<p>On February 20, 1885, the hall was crowded. Reporters expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the general feeling when they wondered whether "the eccentric
artist was going to sketch, to pose, to sing, or to rhapsodise," and were
frankly astonished when the "amiable eccentric" chose to appear
simply as "a jaunty, unabashed, composed, and self-satisfied gentleman,
armed with an opera hat and an eye-glass." Others were amazed to
see him "attired in faultless evening dress." The Followers compared
the figure in black against the black background to the <i>Sarasate</i>, and
they recall his hat carefully placed on the table and the long cane as
carefully stood against the wall. Oscar Wilde called him "a miniature
Mephistopheles mocking the majority." The unprejudiced saw the
dignity of his presence and felt the truth and beauty of his words.
Mrs. Anna Lea Merritt writes us:</p>

<p>"It is always a delight to remember that actually once Mr. Whistler
was really shy. Those who had the pleasure of hearing the first
<i>Ten O'Clock</i> remember that when he came before his puzzled and
distinguished audience there were a few minutes of very palpable
stage-fright."</p>

<p>He had notes, but he seldom referred to them. He held his audience
from the first, and Mrs. D'Oyly Carte recalled the hush in the hall
when he came to his description of London transfigured, a fairyland in
the night. "I went to laugh and I stayed to praise," is the late Lewis
F. Day's account to us, and others were generous enough to make the
same admission. Whistler forced his audience to listen because he spoke
with conviction. <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> was the statement of truths which
his contemporaries were doing their best to forget. When we read
it to-day, our surprise is that things so obvious needed saying. Yet
the need exists to-day more than ever. Almost every one of Whistler's
propositions and statements has been traduced or ignored by critics,
who are incapable of leading thought or are dealers in disguise, and
painters compare their puny selves and petty financial scrapes to
Whistler's magnificent efforts and complete success in his battles for
art and his reputation.</p>

<p>To this lecture we owe the most interesting profession of artistic
faith ever made by an artist. At the time it was given there was a
reaction, outside the Academy, against the anecdote and sentiment
of Victorian art. Ruskin through his books, the Pre-Raphaelites
through their pictures, had spread the doctrine that art was a question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of ethics and industry. Pater preached that it belonged to the past,
William Morris taught that it sprang from the people and to the people
must return. Strange, sad-coloured creatures clad themselves in strange,
sad-coloured garments and admired each other. Many besides Oscar
Wilde profitably peddled in the provinces what they prigged or picked
up; artists proclaimed the political importance of art; parsons discovered
in it a new salvation. "Art was upon the town," as Whistler
said. But ethics and business, fashion and socialism had captured
it. <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> was a protest against the crimes committed in
the name of art, against the belief that art belonged to the past or
concerned the people, that its object was to teach or to elevate. "Art
and Joy go together," he said, the world's masters were never reformers,
never missionaries, but, content with their surroundings, found beauty
everywhere. There was no great past, no mean present, for art, no
drawing of lines between the marbles of the Greek and the fans and
broideries of Japan. There was no artistic period, no art-loving
people. Art happened, and, in a few eloquent words, he told the
history of its happening and the coming of the cheap and tawdry,
when the taste of the tradesman supplanted the science of the artist,
and the multitude rejoiced. Art is a science&mdash;the science by which
the artist picks and chooses and groups the elements contained in
Nature, that beauty may result. For "Nature is very rarely right,
to such an extent even, that it might almost be said that Nature is
usually wrong." He has been so frequently misunderstood that it
may be well to emphasise the meaning of these two assertions, the rock
upon which his faith was founded. Art happens because the artist may
happen anywhere at any time; art is a science not because painters
maintain that it is concerned with laws of light or chemistry of colours
or scientific problems, but because it is exact in its methods and in its
results. The artist can leave no more to chance than the chemist
or the botanist or the biologist. Knowledge may and does increase
and develop, but the laws of art are unalterable. Because art is a science
the critic who is not an artist speaks without authority and would
prize a picture as a "hieroglyph or symbol of story," or for anything
save the painter's poetry which is the reason for its existence, "the
amazing invention that shall have put form and colour into such perfect
harmony, that exquisiteness is the result." The conditions of art
are degraded by these "middlemen," the critics, and by the foolish
who would go back because the thumb of the mountebank jerked the
other way. He laughed at the pretence of the State as fosterer of
art&mdash;art that roams as she will, from the builders of the Parthenon
to the opium-eaters of Nankin, from the Master at Madrid to Hokusai
at the foot of Fusiyama. His denial of an artistic period or an art-loving
people was his defence of art against those who would bound it by
dates and confine it within topographical limits. He meant, not
that a certain period might not produce artists and people to appreciate
them, but that art is independent of time and place, "seeking and
finding the beautiful in all conditions and in all times, as did her
high priest, Rembrandt, when he saw picturesque grandeur and noble
dignity in the Jews' quarter of Amsterdam, and lamented not that its
inhabitants were not Greeks.</p>

<p>"As did Tintoret and Paul Veronese, among the Venetians, while not
halting to change the brocaded silks for the classic draperies of Athens.</p>

<p>"As did, at the Court of Philip, Velasquez, whose Infantas, clad in
inæsthetic hoops, are, as works of Art, of the same quality as the Elgin
Marbles."</p>

<p>As did, he might have added, Whistler, during the reign of Victoria, in
his portraits and Nocturnes which have carried on the art of the world.</p>

<p>His argument was clear and his facts, misunderstood, are becoming
the <i>clichés</i> of this generation. Critics, photographers, even Royal
Academicians have appropriated the truths of <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, for
strange things are happening to the memory of the Idle Apprentice.
He made his points wittily; he chose his words and rounded his
sentences with the feeling for the beautiful that ruled his painting.
<i>The Ten O'Clock</i> has passed into literature. Those Sunday wrestlings
with Scripture in Lowell, that getting of the Psalms by heart at
Stonington developed a style the literary artist may envy. This
style in <i>Art and Art Critics</i> had its roughness. He pruned and chastened
it in his letters to the papers, devoting infinite thought and trouble
to them, for he, more than most men, believed that whatever he had
to do was worth doing with all his might. He would write and rewrite
them, and drive editors mad by coming at the busiest hour to correct
the proof, working over it an hour or more, and then returning to
change a word or a comma, while press and printers waited, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
got so excited once he forgot his eye-glass&mdash;and the editor stole it,
and, of course, later lost it. In his correspondence he was as scrupulous,
and we have known him make a rough draft of a letter to his bootmaker
in Paris, and ask us to dictate it to him while he wrote his fair copy,
as a final touch addressing it to M. &mdash;&mdash;, <i>Maître Bottier</i>. In <i>The
Ten O'Clock</i> he brought his style to perfection. His philosophy,
based on the eternal truths of art, was expressed with the beauty that
endures for all time.</p>

<p>The critics treated Whistler's lecture as they treated his exhibitions.
The <i>Daily News</i> was almost alone in owning that its quality was a
surprise. The <i>Times</i> had the country with it when it said that "the
audience, hoping for an hour's amusement from the eccentric genius
of the artist, were not disappointed." "The eccentric freak of an
amiable, humorous, and accomplished gentleman," was the <i>Daily
Telegraph's</i> opinion. Oscar Wilde, in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, was shocked
that an artist should talk of art, and was unwilling to accept the fact
that only a painter is a judge of painting. This was natural, for as
an authority on art Wilde had made himself ridiculous. Nor could
he assent to much that Whistler said, for, as a lecturer, he had been
a perambulating advertisement for the æsthetic movement, against
which <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> was a protest. But he was more generous
than other critics in acknowledging the beauty of the lecture and the
earnestness of the lecturer, though he could not finish his notice without
one parting shot at the man whose target he had often been: "that he
is indeed one of the very greatest masters of painting is my opinion. And
I may add that, in this opinion, Mr. Whistler himself entirely concurs."
This was not the sort of thing Whistler could pass over. His answer led
to a correspondence which made another chapter in <i>The Gentle Art</i>.</p>

<p>Whistler repeated <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> several times; early in March
before the British Artists, and later in the same month (the 24th)
before the University Art Society at Cambridge, where he spent the
night with Sir Sidney Colvin, who writes us, "beyond the mere fact
that Whistler dined with me in Hall and had some chat there with
Prince Edward&mdash;an amiable youth who was a little scared at the idea
of having to talk art (of which he was blankly ignorant) but whom
Whistler soon put at his ease; I have no precise recollection of what
passed." What a pity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>On April 30 he gave his lecture at Oxford. Mr. Sidney Starr
"went down with Whistler and his brother, 'Doctor Willie,' to the
Mitre. The lecture hall was small, with primitive benches, and the
audience was small. The lecture was delivered impressively, but
lacking the original emphasis and sparkle. Whistler hated to do
anything twice over, and this was the fourth time."</p>

<p>The fifth time was about the same date, at the Royal Academy
Students' Club in Golden Square, an unexplained accident, and the
sixth at the Fine Art Society's. Dr. Moncure Conway wrote us a
year before his death that he heard <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> at Lady Jeune's,
but Lady Jeune does not recollect it. Whistler we are sure would
have remembered and recorded it. There was a suggestion, which
came to nothing, of taking it on an American tour and to Paris. It
was heard twice more in London, once at the Grosvenor Gallery in
February 1888. Val Prinsep recalled Whistler's "pressing invitation"
for him and Leighton to attend:</p>

<p>"During the time he was president of the British Artists, he and
the other heads of art sometimes were asked to dine by our President
(Leighton). 'Rather late to ask <i>me</i>, don't you think?' Whistler
remarked. After dinner, he pressed Leighton and me to come to his
lecture, which was to be delivered a few days after. 'What's the use
of me coming?' Leighton said sadly. 'You know I should not agree
with what you said, my dear Whistler!' 'Oh,' cried Whistler, 'come
all the same; nobody takes me seriously, don't you know!'"</p>

<p>It was heard for the last time three years later (1891) at the Chelsea
Arts Club, which had just started and proposed to hold lectures and
discussions; it now gives fancy-dress balls and boxing matches. Before
the club found a home it was suggested that the first of these meetings
should be at the Cadogan Pier Hotel, and Whistler was invited to
read <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, but his answer was, "No, gentlemen, let us go
to no beer hotel," and <i>The Ten O'Clock</i> was put off until the clubhouse
in the King's Road was opened.</p>

<p><i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, originally set up by Mr. Way, was published
by Messrs. Chatto and Windus in the spring of 1888. It had much
the same reception when it was printed as when it was delivered. The
only criticism Whistler took seriously was an article by Swinburne
in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> for June 1888.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Swinburne objected to Whistler's praise of Japanese art, to his
rigid line between art and literature, to his incursion as "brilliant
amateur" into the region of letters, to his denial of the possibility
of an artistic period or an art-loving people, and to much else besides.
All this might have passed, but Swinburne went further. He questioned
the seriousness of Whistler. He twisted Whistler's meaning to suit his
weighty humour, and then, in a surprising vein of insolence, re-echoed
the popular verdict. The witty tongue must be thrust into the smiling
cheek, he thought, when Whistler wrote, "Art and Joy go together,"
which meant, according to Swinburne, that tragic art is not art
at all.</p>

<p>"'Arter that, let's have a glass of wine,' said a famous countryman
of Mr. Whistler's, on the memorable occasion when he was impelled
to address his friend Mr. Brick in the immortal words, 'keep cool,
Jefferson, don't bust.' The admonition may not improbably be
required by the majority of readers who come suddenly and unawares
upon this transcendent and pyramidal pleasantry. The laughing muse
of the lecturer, '<i>quam Focus circumvolat</i>,' must have glanced round in
expectation of the general appeal, 'After that, let us take breath.'
And having done so, they must have remembered that they were not
in a serious world; that they were in the fairyland of fans, in the
paradise of pipkins, in the limbo of blue china, screens, pots, plates,
jars, joss-houses, and all the fortuitous frippery of Fusiyama."</p>

<p>This is quoted as an example of Swinburnian humour. The rest
of the article is offensive and ridiculous&mdash;the brilliant poet but
ponderous prose writer trying to be funny&mdash;with references to the
"jester of genius," to the "tumbler or clown," to the "gospel of the
grin." It was this that hurt&mdash;that Swinburne, the poet, "also misunderstood,"
could laugh with the crowd at the "eccentricity" and
levity of Whistler. Swinburne's criticism was easy to answer, and
was answered in two of the comments printed, with extracts from
the article, in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. "That tragic art is not art at all"
is, Whistler wrote, Swinburne's "own inconsequence," and this
<i>Reflection</i> appears on the opposite margin:</p>

<p>"Is not, then, the funeral hymn a gladness to the singer, if the
verse be beautiful?</p>

<p>"Certainly the funeral monument, to be worthy the Nation's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
sorrow buried beneath it, must first be a joy to the sculptor who
designed it.</p>

<p>"The Bard's reasoning is of the People. The Tragedy is <i>theirs</i>.
As one of them the <i>man</i> may weep&mdash;yet will the artist rejoice, for to
him is not 'a thing of beauty a joy for ever'?"</p>

<p>To the <i>World</i> Whistler wrote the letter called "Freeing a Last
Friend" in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. It is short, the sting in the concluding
paragraph:</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear! I have lost a <i>confrère</i>; but then, I
have gained an acquaintance&mdash;one Algernon Swinburne&mdash;'outsider'&mdash;Putney."</p>

<p>The letter was sent to Swinburne before it appeared in the <i>World</i>.
We have been told that it was received at Putney one Sunday morning
when Mr. Watts-Dunton was to breakfast with Whistler. Suspecting
that the letter might not be friendly, Mr. Watts-Dunton took it,
unopened, with him to Chelsea and begged Whistler to withdraw it.
Whistler refused. Mr. Watts-Dunton left the house without breakfasting,
and the same day the letter was delivered to Swinburne, who,
after reading it, pale with rage, swore that never again would he speak
to Whistler. As a result, Mr. Watts-Dunton, we believe, was at
pains to avoid Whistler, fearful of a rupture with him. Mr. Meredith
had discovered years before that the springs in Whistler were prompt
for the challenge, and it cannot be denied that he had reason to see a
challenge in Swinburne's article. How much it hurt he did not conceal
in <i>The Gentle Art</i>, where the extracts from Swinburne are followed
immediately by <i>Et tu, Brute</i>, and there is nothing more dignified,
almost pathetic, in the volume:</p>

<p>"... Cannot the man who wrote <i>Atalanta</i>, and the <i>Ballads
Beautiful</i>&mdash;can he not be content to spend his life with <i>his</i> work, which
should be his love, and has for him no misleading doubt and darkness,
that he should so stray about blindly in his brother's flower beds and
bruise himself!...</p>

<p>"Who are you deserting your Muse, that you should insult my
Goddess with familiarity, and the manners of approach common to
the reasoners in the market-place? 'Hearken to me,' you cry, 'and
I will point out how this man, who has passed his life in her
worship, is a tumbler and a clown of the booths, how he who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
produced that which I fain must acknowledge, is a jester in the
ring!'</p>

<p>"Do we not speak the same language? Are we strangers, then,
or, in our Father's house are there so many mansions that you lose
your way, my brother, and cannot recognise your kin?...</p>

<p>"You have been misled, you have mistaken the pale demeanour
and joined hands for an outward and visible sign of an inward and
spiritual earnestness. For you, these are the serious ones, and, for
them, you others are the serious matter. Their joke is their work.
For me&mdash;why should I refuse myself the grim joy of this grotesque
tragedy&mdash;and, with them now, you are all my joke!"</p>

<p>And Swinburne, in pitiful spite, we have been told, burned Whistler's
letters, and tried to sell <i>La Mère Gérard</i> which Whistler had given
him. Later, Mr. Watts-Dunton is said to have stated that Whistler
asked Swinburne to write the article, and also that he tried to make
peace between them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX: THE BRITISH ARTISTS. THE RISE.<br />
THE YEARS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-FOUR TO EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-SIX.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the autumn of 1884, Whistler joined the Society of British Artists.
Years later, when a British Artist was dining with us, Whistler came in.
"A delightful evening," he said, towards midnight, the British Artist
having gone, "but what was it for the British Artist sitting there, face
to face with his late President?" And then, he told us how he became
connected with the Society:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, one day at my studio in Chelsea, a deputation
arrived&mdash;Ayerst Ingram and one or two others. And there they were&mdash;and
I received them charmingly, of course&mdash;and they represented to me
that the British Artists' was an old and distinguished Society, possibly
as old as the Academy, and maybe older, and they had come to ask me
if I would do them the honour of becoming a member. It was only
right I should know that the Society's fortunes were at a low ebb, but
they wished to put new life into it. I felt the ceremony of the occasion.
Whatever the Society was at the moment, it had a past, and they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
there with all official authority to pay me a compliment. I accepted
the offer with appropriate courtesy. As always, I understood the ceremonial
of the occasion&mdash;and then, almost as soon as I was made a
member I was elected President."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1906 Sir Alfred East, President of the British
Artists, and the Council, with the courtesy Whistler would have
approved, gave us permission to consult the minute-books. The first
mention of Whistler is in the minutes of the half-yearly general meeting,
November 21, 1884, held at the Suffolk Street Galleries, when it was
proposed "that Mr. Whistler be invited to join the Society as a member.
A discussion took place concerning the law of electing Mr. Whistler
by ballot, when it was proposed by Mr. Bayliss, seconded by Mr.
Cauty, that the law relating to the election of members be suspended."
This was carried, and the <i>Times</i> (December 3, 1884) said: "Artistic
society was startled by the news that this most wayward, most
un-English of painters had found a home among the men of Suffolk
Street, of all people in the world."</p>

<p>Whistler had never belonged to any society in England, and had
never been asked, though we believe he was a Freemason; at any rate
he had a pair of sleeve buttons with masonic emblems&mdash;apparently&mdash;on
them. He was fifty, an age when most men have "arrived"
officially, if they "arrive" at all. Up to this moment he had stood
apart from every school and group and movement in the country. He
was as much a foreigner as when he came, a quarter of a century before,
from Paris. He was a puzzle to the people, more American than
English in appearance, manners, and standards. His short, slight
figure, dark colouring and abundant curls, his vivacity of gesture, his
American accent, his gaiety, his sense of honour, his quick resentment
of an insult, were foreign and, therefore, to be suspected, and his personality
increased the suspicion with which his art was regarded. Recent
writers have analysed his work and pointed out where it is American,
French, Japanese. But to his contemporaries it did not matter
what these tendencies were, the result was not English. His art, in
its aims and methods, was different from theirs, to them he seemed in
deliberate opposition, ruled by caprice, straining after novelty and
notoriety.</p>

<p>When Whistler came to England, art was the Academy, an Academy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
that had strangled the traditions of art and set up sentiment and
anecdote. Wilkie explained the ideal of the nineteenth-century
Academician when he said that "to know the taste of the public&mdash;to
learn what will best please the employer&mdash;is, to an artist, the most
valuable of all knowledge"; and the Royal Academy has only carried
on the canny tradition. The classic machines of Leighton, Tadema,
and Poynter appealed to the artless scholar; the idylls of Millais,
Marcus Stone, and Leslie to the artless sentimentalist. Watts preached
sermons for the artless serious, Stacy Marks raised a laugh in the artless
humorist, Herbert and Long edified the artless pious. Every taste
was catered to. Everybody could understand, and art had never been
so popular in England. The Academy became a social power. As
art was the last thing looked for on the walls, so the artist was the
last thing looked for in the Academician. The situation is summed
up in Whistler's reply to a group of ladies who were praising
Leighton:</p>

<p>"He is such a wonderful musician! such a gallant colonel! such
a brilliant orator! such a dignified President! such a charming host!
such an amazing linguist!" they chorused. "H'm, paints, too, don't
he, among his other accomplishments?" said Whistler.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary state of affairs. "Art," was little more
than an excuse for intrigues and trivialities. Men who were thought
daring in rebellion and leaders of secessions did not improve matters.
The Pre-Raphaelites were absorbed in subject, though it was of another
kind, and though they paid greater attention to technique and preached,
as reformers always have, a return to Nature. Their insistence upon
detail and finish, instead of opening their eyes, closed them more hopelessly
by making it a duty to see nothing save unimportant facts, and to
copy these like a machine. The exception, Alfred Stevens, who neither
stooped to the taste of public or patron, nor confused the artist with
the missionary, was as complete a pariah as Whistler, and he died
unknown and unrecognised.</p>

<p>The position in France was different. French officialism respected
tradition. The art of the academic painters might be frigid, conventional,
dull, but it was never petty and trivial, never strove to please
by escape from drawing and colour. Gleyre, Ary Scheffer, Couture
were the masters Whistler found in Paris. Their successors&mdash;Gérôme,
Jean-Paul Laurens, Bouguereau, Bonnat&mdash;did not altogether throw
their dignity as artists to the winds of popularity, or sacrifice it to
social ambition. The rebels in France were not actuated by moral
or literary motives, but broke away from conservatism. Rebellion sent
Holman Hunt to Palestine, Rossetti to mediævalism, Burne-Jones to
legend; it kept Courbet at home, for the true was the beautiful and
truth was to be found in the life and the people about him. Moreover,
the painter was to see these things through, not a microscope, but his
eyes. No man who looks upon a broad landscape can count the blades
of grass in a field, or the leaves of ivy on a wall, or the stars in the
heavens; the eye can take in only the whole, enveloped in atmosphere,
bathed in light, shrouded in darkness, all things keeping their places in
their planes. While in England the artist was searching the Scriptures
and the Encyclopædia for subject, in France he was training his eye to
see things as they are and his hand to render them. This preoccupation
with Nature, and the study of tone, gave artists new pictorial and
technical problems, and subject counted for nothing except as an aid
to their right solution. It is curious to contrast the work of the men
in France and England of the same generation as Whistler. Fantin-Latour
grouped his friends about the portrait of Delacroix, Leighton
rearranged a procession of early Florentines carrying the Madonna of
Cimabue through his idea of the streets. Manet noted the play of light
and colour in the bull-rings of Spain, Tadema rebuilt on his canvas what
he thought were the arenas of ancient Rome. Degas chose his models
among the washerwomen and ballet-girls of modern Paris, Rossetti
borrowing his subjects from Dante.</p>

<p>Whistler, from his first picture, was as preoccupied with the beauty
in the "familiar" as his French fellow students. What might have
happened had he remained in France, it is idle to discuss. Coming
to England he developed in his own way, and this was a way with
which English painters had no sympathy. He was so isolated that
nothing has been more difficult for the historian of modern art than to
place, to classify him. Some authorities have included him among
the Realists. His work eventually differed from that of Courbet and
Courbet's disciples, but he was always as much a realist as they in his
preference for the world in which he lived, and in his study of the
relations of the things he found in it. He never wavered, except when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
he painted the Japanese pictures, and then he was not led astray by
anecdote or sentiment, but by the beauty that had drifted from Japan
into his house and studio. London, dirty, gloomy, despised by most
artists, with its little shops and taverns in the fog-bound streets; the
Thames, with its ugly warehouses and gaunt factories in the mist-laden
night; the crinolines of the sixties; the clinging, tight draperies of
the seventies, became beautiful as he saw them. He made no effort
to reform Nature, only reserving his right to select the elements
that were beautiful and could be brought together, as notes in
music, to create harmony, putting into practice his teaching of <i>The
Ten O'Clock</i>. He sought colour, mass, not detail. The Pre-Raphaelites
wanted to leave out less than a camera, he wanted to put in no more
than came within his vision. He turned his back on history and
archæology, and filled his canvas with beauty of line and form. And
he struggled to perfect his technical methods, to make of them a perfect
medium by which to express this beauty, to reconcile what he could see
in Nature with what his brush could render. The Pre-Raphaelites
laboured over their canvas, inch by inch; he painted his whole picture
at once that unity might result. The Academicians lost their way in
literary labyrinths; he lingered on the river, learning its secrets,
he watched the movement, the pose of people about him. The modern
exhibition forced most painters into violent colour and exaggerated
action, he made no concession, though he was ready to submit his
pictures to the same tests as theirs.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that his English contemporaries could make
nothing of him and his work. The Academician saw but emptiness in
his paintings. To the Pre-Raphaelites they were slovenly and superficial.
Holman Hunt said of him that he knew where to leave off, and
was careful in the avoidance of difficulties; Millais thought him "a
great power of mischief among young men, a man who had never learnt
the grammar of his art." The critics took their cue from the painters,
the more willingly because art criticism then meant analysis of the subject
of a picture, and there was no subject in Whistler's work to analyse.
Yet he never objected to subject. It was only the blind critics and
the blind painters of the day who said he did, and their stupidity
is still aped. The great pictures for him were Velasquez's <i>Meniñas</i>
Franz Hals' <i>Family</i>, Tintoretto's <i>Milky Way</i>: the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
subject-pictures in the world. All he objected to was the cheap drivel or
sentiment of the painter whose mind or whose audience never rose
above Mummie's Darling or the Mustard Pot, the real British school
trampled on by Hogarth. The public, following their leaders, were
convinced that Whistler's work was empty, slight, trivial, an insult
to their intelligence, unless they took it as a jest. Nothing explains
the popular conception of him better than the readiness to see eccentricity
even in methods which he, "heir to all the ages," had inherited.
His long-handled brushes and his manner of placing sitter and canvas
were eccentric, though they had been Gainsborough's a century before.
To say that a picture was finished from the beginning was no less eccentric,
though it was Baudelaire's axiom that the author foresees the last
line of his work when he writes the first. It is easier to make than to
lose the reputation for eccentricity, fatal to success in a land of conservatism.
Whistler saw the Englishmen who had studied in Paris with him
laden with honours; Poynter a prosperous painter, Leighton a perfect
President, Du Maurier the popular idol of <i>Punch</i>, Armstrong a State
functionary at South Kensington, while he remained, officially, on the
outside, at fifty less honoured than at twenty-five, because, it was said,
that he had not realised the promise of his youth.</p>

<p>In one respect his position had changed. His contemporaries did
not alter their opinion, but younger artists accepted him and his
teaching unquestioningly for a time. Though doubted and mistrusted,
he had never been without influence. To look over old reviews and
notices of exhibitions is to find references to the effect of his example.
In the <i>Art Journal</i> (June 1887), Sir Walter Armstrong traced the
growing influence of French on English art to the Paris Universal
Exhibition of 1867 and to Whistler. But artists of the new generation
went further than the admission of his influence; with the enthusiasm
of youth, they proclaimed his greatness. He was their master&mdash;the
one master in England. After his return from Venice, when his
fortunes were at their lowest and the public held him in most contempt,
this enthusiasm began to make itself heard and felt in the studios and
the schools.</p>

<p>The British Artists, uncertain of their future, took desperate
remedies. The Society was old, with distinguished chapters in its
history. It was formed by one of the first groups who realised the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
necessity for an association in self-defence against the monopoly of
the Academy. It dated back to the beginning of the nineteenth century.
With the old Water Colour Society, it was considered only second in
rank to the Academy. Its gallery was in Suffolk Street, near enough
to the Academy to profit by any overflow of visitors, until the Academy
moved from Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly. The old Water Colour
Society was more independent, because it is devoted to a branch of art
never acknowledged by the Academy, though every Academician tries
to sneak in. But the British Artists suffered from this removal, and
found a formidable rival in the Grosvenor Gallery. In Whistler, with
his following, they seemed to see the man to drag them from the mire
into which they had sunk. The older members hesitated&mdash;afraid of
Whistler, afraid of the Academy, afraid of themselves. But the younger
members carried the day.</p>

<p>Whistler worked hard for the Society from his election till his
resignation. He attended his first meeting on December 1, 1884, and
interested himself immediately in the affairs of the Society, though,
according to Mr. Ludovici, this was the last thing the Society expected
of him. He promptly invited his President and fellow members to
breakfast in Tite Street, and, as promptly, was put on a committee for a
smoking concert, a dull and ponderous function. He sent to the Winter
Exhibition (1884-85) two pictures, <i>Arrangement in Black, No. II.</i>, the
portrait of Mrs. Louis Huth, not exhibited in London since 1874, and a
water-colour, <i>A Little Red Note, Dordrecht</i>; in the Summer Exhibition
(1885) he showed the <i>Sarasate</i> for the first time. Mr. Cole wrote in
his diary:</p>

<p>"<i>October 19th</i> (1884). M. and I went to tea with Whistler to see
his fine full-length of Sarasate, the violinist, for next year's Academy."</p>

<p>But whatever his original intention may have been, the <i>Sarasate</i>
went to Suffolk Street with several small Notes and Harmonies. If,
in electing him, the British Artists hoped to attract attention to their
exhibition, they were not disappointed. "The eccentric Mr. Whistler
has gone to a neglected little gallery, the British Artists, which he will
probably bring into fashion," Mr. (now Sir) Claude Phillips wrote in the
<i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> (July 1885), and this is what happened. The distinction
of the <i>Sarasate</i> could not be denied. But in his other work he
was pronounced "vastly amusing," the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> seizing this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
occasion to remind him of "Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes' virtuous
determination never to be as funny as he could. It is so bad for the
young." Soon Whistler proposed that Sunday receptions should be
given in the gallery, and that medals should be awarded. He got
Mr. Menpes in as a water-colourist, thus establishing distinct sections
in the Society, a scheme he carried out in the International Society of
Sculptors, Painters, and Gravers, and he suggested that photographs of
pictures shown should be sold in the gallery, an idea copied all over
the world. For the Winter Exhibition of 1885-86 he had another interesting
group, including the <i>Portrait of Mrs. Cassatt</i> and a <i>Note in
Green and Violet</i>. The <i>Mrs. Cassatt</i> has not been exhibited in England
since, and is one of the least known of his portraits. Mr. Cassatt, who
was among the few believers in Whistler at this period, came from Paris
to London in April 1883, especially to have it painted, and was with
Mrs. Cassatt during the sittings at 13 Tite Street. She has vivid
memories of the brilliant talk between the two men. It is amusing that
Whistler, after having told them the story of <i>The Peacock Room</i>, should
have himself arranged for them to see it, and that then they heard
Leyland's story. Mrs. Cassatt wanted to be painted in an evening
gown. Mr. Cassatt preferred her riding habit. "The very thing,"
said Whistler, and so in her riding habit and tall hat she stands on
the canvas. Perhaps it was because of her disappointment that she
could not see a likeness in the portrait. Whistler realised this, but, he
told her, "After all, it's a Whistler." Mr. Cassatt, punctilious in these
matters, paid Whistler for the painting before he returned to America.
Two years passed, and still no portrait. Whistler had probably kept
it back for the British Artists. Mr. Cassatt at last wrote. They had
their reward for the delay. A letter of apologies came from Whistler
and was followed by a case, with not only the portrait in it, but <i>The
Chelsea Girl</i>, a painting as little known, and now reproduced for the
first time as far as we have record.</p>

<p>At the British Artists the <i>Note in Green and Violet</i>, a small pastel of a
nude, created a far greater sensation than the portrait. About a month
before the show opened, the late J. C. Horsley, R.A., had read, during a
Church Congress, a paper no one would have given a thought to had not
Whistler immortalised it. Horsley said:</p>

<p>"If those who talk and write so glibly as to the desirability of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
artists devoting themselves to the representation of the naked human
form, only knew a tithe of the degradation enacted before the
model is sufficiently hardened to her shameful calling, they would
for ever hold their tongues and pens in supporting the practice. Is
not clothedness a distinct type and feature of our Christian
faith? All art representations of nakedness are out of harmony
with it."</p>

<p>Whistler answered with "one of the little things that Providence
sometimes sent him": "<i>Horsley soit qui mal y pense</i>," he wrote on a
label, and fastened it to the <i>Note in Green and Violet</i>. The British
Artists were alarmed, for to enter Suffolk Street was not to abandon
hope of the Academy. The label was removed, not before it had been
seen. The critic of the <i>Pall Mall</i> referred to it as Whistler's "indignant
protest against the idea that there is any immorality in the nude."
Whistler, who knew when ridicule served better than indignation,
wrote: "Art certainly requires no 'indignant protest' against the
unseemliness of senility. <i>Horsley soit qui mal y pense</i> is meanwhile a
sweet sentiment&mdash;why more&mdash;and why 'morality'?" But the critic
could not understand, and he was discovered one day "walking in Pall
Mall with the nude on his arm."</p>

<p>The revenue of the Society had been rapidly decreasing, a deficit of
five hundred pounds had to be faced. To meet it Whistler proposed
that the luncheon to the Press be discontinued. It was an almost
general custom then to feast the critics at press views of picture exhibitions.
But in few was the cloth more lavishly spread than at the
British Artists', in few were boxes of cigars and whiskies-and-sodas
placed so conveniently. The younger critics resented it, the old ones
lived for it. Press day, the dreariest in the year at the Royal Academy,
was the most delightful at the British Artists', they said. Mr. Sidney
Starr tells a story of one, when Whistler had not hung his picture, but
only the frame:</p>

<p>"Telegrams were sent imploring the placing of the canvas. But
the only answer that came was, 'The Press have ye always with you;
feed my lambs.' A smoking-concert followed during the exhibition.
At this, one critic said to the Master, 'Your picture is not up to your
mark, it is not good this time.' 'You should not say it isn't good;
you should say you don't like it, and then, you know, you're perfectly
safe; now come and have something you do like, have some whisky,'
said Whistler."</p>

<p>In the place of the luncheon, Whistler suggested a Sunday breakfast
when members should pay for themselves and their guests. But
members were horrified; his motion was lost.</p>

<p>In April 1886, Mr. William Graham's collection came up for auction
at Christie's. The sale brought to it the buyers and admirers of
Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Holman Hunt, many of whose pictures Graham
had bought. Whistler's <i>Nocturne in Blue and Silver (Blue and Gold),
Old Battersea Bridge</i> belonged to him. When it appeared "there was
a slight attempt at an ironical cheer, which being mistaken for serious
applause, was instantly suppressed by an angry hiss all round," and it
was sold for sixty pounds to Mr. R. H. C. Harrison. Whistler acknowledged
through the <i>Observer</i> (April 11, 1886), "the distinguished,
though I fear unconscious, compliment so publicly paid." Such
recognition rarely, he said, came to the painter during his lifetime, and
to his friends he spoke of it as an unheard-of success, the first time such
a thing had happened. The hisses in their ears, the British Artists were
dismayed by his one contribution to the Summer Exhibition of 1886.
This was a <i>Harmony in Blue and Gold</i>, a full-length of a girl in draperies
of blue and green, leaning against a railing and holding a parasol, an
arrangement, like the <i>Six Projects</i>, uniting classic design with Japanese
detail. The draperies were transparent, and to defy Horsley and the
British Matron was no part of the British Artists' policy. They were
doubtless the more shocked when they read the comments in the Press.
The most amusing revelation of British prudery, worth preserving as
typical, appeared in the <i>Court and Society Review</i> (June 24, 1886) in
a letter, signed "A Country Collector," protesting against the praise
of Mr. Malcolm Salaman, who was the art critic of that paper:</p>

<p>"I am invited to gaze at an unfinished, rubbishy sketch of a young
woman, who, if she is not naked, ought to be, for she would then be
more decent.... The figure is more naked than nude: the colour
what there is of it, is distinctly unpleasant. For my part, sir, I will
not believe in Mr. Whistler; my daughters have commanded me to
admire him&mdash;I will <i>not</i> admire him. How they can quietly stare at the
ill-painted, sooty-faced young woman in 'blue and gold' passes me.
But things are altered now, and my girls gaze with critical calmness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and carefully balanced <i>pince-nez</i> on that which would have sent their
grandmothers shrieking from the gallery."</p>

<p>And Whistler, he declared, was a "poseur" and the picture "a
colossal piece of pyramidal impudence."</p>

<p>Whistler was not represented at the Grosvenor, and at the <i>Salon</i>
only by the <i>Sarasate</i>, which went afterwards to the "XX" Club in
Brussels. His show in 1886 was at Messrs. Dowdeswell's Gallery.
They exhibited and published for him the <i>Set of Twenty-Six Etchings</i>,
twenty-one of the plates done in Venice, the other five in England,
the price fifty guineas. With the prints he issued the often-quoted
<i>Propositions</i>, the first series; the laws, as he defined them, of etching.
He said that in etching, as in every other art, the space covered should
be in proportion to the means used for covering it, and that the delicacy
of the needle demands the smallness of the plate; that the "Remarque,"
then in vogue, emanated from the amateur; that there should be no
margin to receive a "Remarque"; and that the habit of margin also
came from the outsider. For a few years these <i>Propositions</i> were
accepted by artists. At the present time they are ignored or defied,
and the bigger the plate the better pleased is the etcher and his public.
Later in the year, in May, Messrs. Dowdeswell arranged in their gallery
a second series of <i>Notes&mdash;Harmonies&mdash;Nocturnes</i>. A few were in oil,
a few in pencil, but the larger number were pastels and water-colours.
They were studies of the nude, impressions of the sea at Dieppe and
Dover, St. Ives and Trouville, the little shops of London and Paris, the
skies and canals of Holland. Whistler decorated the room in Brown and
Gold, choosing the brown paper for the walls, designing the mouldings
of the dado. Mr. Walter Dowdeswell has the sketch of the scheme
in raw umber, yellow ochre, raw sienna, and white; he has also
preserved the brown-and-yellow hangings, and the yellow velarium.
On the cover for the mantelpiece, the Butterfly, placed to one side,
is without a sting. "Where is the sting?" Mr. Dowdeswell asked.
"That," Whistler said, "is in my waistcoat pocket. I am keeping
it for the critics." The exhibition was received with mingled praise
and blame, and it would not have been a success financially had not
Mr. H. S. Theobald, K.C., purchased all that earlier buyers left on
Messrs. Dowdeswell's hands.</p>

<p>In the following summer Mr. Burr refused to stand again for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Presidency, and at a General Meeting (June 1, 1886), Whistler was
elected. The excitement was intense. Whistler alone was calm and
unmoved. Mr. Ingram, a scrutineer, remembers coming for Whistler's
vote and being so excited that Whistler tried to reassure him: "Never
mind, never mind, you've done your best!" The meeting adjourned
to the Hogarth Club for supper. "<i>J'y suis, j'y reste</i>," Whistler wired
his brother. The comic papers were full of caricatures, the serious
papers of astonishment. He was hailed as "President Whistler" by
his friends, and denounced by members of the Society as an artist with
no claim to be called British. Younger painters rushed to his support,
and one French critic, Marcel Roland, prophesied that, "<i>l'&oelig;uvre de
Whistler ne quittera son atelier que pour aller tout droit s'ennuyer à jamais
sur les murs des grandes salles du Louvre. La place est marquée entre
Paul Véronèse et Vélasquez.</i>" It was suggested by Mr. Malcolm
Salaman that "all the rising young painters to whom we must look for
the future of British art will flock to the standard of Mr.&mdash;why not Sir
James&mdash;Whistler, rather than to that of Sir Frederick Leighton"&mdash;a
prophecy fulfilled in the early days of the International, while the
question as to whether Whistler would have accepted a knighthood
has lately been discussed. He would doubtlessly, could he have done
so without losing his American citizenship, but he would not have
sold his citizenship for it. Honorary rank and British orders could have
been conferred upon him, as they are often upon foreign politicians,
social nonentities, or useful financiers without loss of their citizenship.
But in British orders, as Lord Melbourne said of the Garter, "there
is no damn question of merit about it."</p>

<p>Whistler intended going to America in the fall, but the journey was
postponed. He wrote to the <i>World</i> (October 13, 1886), "this is no
time for hesitation&mdash;one cannot continually disappoint a Continent,"
and he settled down to the task of directing the fortunes of a Society
which looked to him for help, its members divided among themselves
in their confidence in him as President.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX: THE BRITISH ARTISTS. THE FALL.<br />THE
YEARS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-SIX TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to the constitution of the British Artists the President,
though elected in June, does not take office until December. Whistler
presided for the first time on December 10, 1886, and from that day
he was supported devotedly by one faction and opposed fiercely by the
other.</p>

<p>For the Winter Exhibition (1886-87) he decorated the galleries with
the same care as his own shows. He put up a velarium, he covered the
walls with muslin. The muslin gave out, leaving a bare space under
the ceiling. "But what matter?" he said, "the battens are well
placed, they make good lines," and they became part of the decoration.
He would allow no crowding, the walls were to be the background of
good pictures well spaced, well arranged. He urged the virtue of
rejection. Mr. Starr says, "He was oblivious to every interest but
the quality of the work shown." He told Mr. Menpes, one of the
Hanging Committee, "If you are uncertain for a moment, say 'Out.'
We want clean spaces round our pictures. We want them to be seen.
The British Artists' must cease to be a shop."</p>

<p>This was resented. The modern exhibition is a shop, and as long
as most painters have their way a shop it will remain. He exhibited
<i>Nocturne in Brown and Gold</i> (afterwards <i>Blue and Gold</i>), <i>St. Mark's,
Venice</i>&mdash;he told the members on varnishing day that it was his best;
<i>Harmony in Red: Lamplight</i>, Mrs. Godwin, and <i>Harmony in White and
Ivory</i>, Lady Colin Campbell, a beautiful portrait of a beautiful woman,
one of many that have disappeared. It was not finished when Whistler
sent it in, an excuse for dissatisfied members to propose its removal.
The question was not put to the meeting when the matter came up,
but a proposition to define the rights of the President and the President-elect
was carried.</p>

<p>One of Whistler's first acts was to offer to loan the Society five
hundred pounds to pay its debts. Mr. Starr describes him, "during
this time of fluctuating finances, pawning his large gold <i>Salon</i> medal
one day, lending five hundred pounds to the British Artists the next.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
He often found 'a long face and a short account at the Bank,' he said
one day."</p>

<p>He did everything he could to increase the prestige of the Society.
All that was charming was to be encouraged, all that was tedious was
to be done away with. He got distinguished artists to join: Charles
Keene, Alfred Stevens, and the more promising younger men. He
allowed several to call themselves in the catalogue "pupils of Whistler,"
and to make drawings of the gallery and his pictures for the illustrated
papers. The sketches of <i>Sarasate</i> in the <i>Pall Mall's Pictures of 1885</i>,
and of <i>Harmony in Blue and Gold</i>, and his exhibition at Dowdeswell's
gallery in <i>Pictures of 1886</i> are by him. But after this Mr. Theodore
Roussel, Mr. Walter Sickert, Mr. Sidney Starr made the drawings for
reproduction. He gave the Art Union, organised by the Society, a
plate, <i>The Fish Shop&mdash;Busy Chelsea</i>, one year, and another, a painting
done at St. Ives. In the March meeting (1887) he proposed a limit of
size for exhibits, he contributed twenty pounds towards a scheme of
decoration, and he presented four velvet curtains for the doorways in
the large room. There is a drawing, showing curtains and velarium,
by Mr. Roussel in the <i>Pall Mall's Pictures of 1887</i>. Whistler's early
<i>Nocturne in Blue and Gold, Valparaiso Bay</i>; <i>Nocturne in Black
and Gold, The Gardens</i> (Cremorne); <i>Harmony in Grey, Chelsea in
Ice</i>, were hung, and with them his latest, <i>Arrangement in Violet
and Pink, Portrait of Mrs. Walter Sickert</i>. This is the first of the two
portraits he painted of Mrs. Sickert, and from her we learned that it
was destroyed.</p>

<p>Most of the members regarded the President's innovations as an
interference with their rights. He might pay their debts, that was one
thing; it was another to make their gallery beautiful by chucking their
pictures. Their resentment increased on the occasion of a visit from
the Prince of Wales. Whistler stayed late the day before to finish the
decoration. When the members came, doors and dados were painted
yellow. Whistler, with whom great fault was found, refused to have
anything further to do with the decorations, though they were unfinished.
There was fright carried that evening to a smoking-concert at
the Hogarth Club, where everybody was talking of the arrangement in
yellow. He was telegraphed for. "So discreet of you all at the
Hogarth" was his answer, and he did not appear until it was time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to meet the Prince, though in the meantime members tried to tone
down the yellow. Whistler told us:</p>

<p>"I went downstairs to meet the Prince. As we were walking up,
I a little in front with the Princess, the Prince, who always liked to be
well informed in these matters, asked what the Society was&mdash;Was it
an old institution? What was its history? 'Sir, it has none, its
history dates from to-day!' I said."</p>

<p>But the old members say that when the Prince went downstairs
with one of them his remark was: "Who is that funny little man we
have been talking to?"</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction was brought before a meeting, when a proposition
was made and passed "that the experiment of hanging pictures in an
isolated manner be discontinued," and that, in future, enough works
be accepted to cover the vacant space above and below the line&mdash;in fact,
that the gallery be hung as before. It is said that some members made
an estimate of the amount of wall-space left bare, and calculated the
loss in pounds, shillings and pence.</p>

<p>We saw this exhibition, though we did not see Whistler. We
remember the quiet, well-spaced walls, and the portrait of Mrs. Sickert,
also works by Dannat and William Stott. It should not be forgotten
that the British Artists' was arranged and hung by Whistler years before
there was any idea of artistic hanging in German Secessions&mdash;we believe,
before there were any Secessions. Whistler had applied to his own
shows the same method of spacing and hanging, and decorating the
walls with an appropriate colour-scheme. It had occurred to no one
before him that beautiful things should be shown beautifully, and it is
not too much to say that the attention given to-day to the artistic
arrangement of picture exhibitions is due entirely to Whistler. The
resurrection of the velarium, designed, made, and hung after his scheme,
has revolutionised the lighting of picture galleries, though in very few
is his scheme intelligently followed.</p>

<p>1887 was Queen Victoria's Jubilee, and every society of artists
prepared addresses to Her Majesty; Whistler could not permit his
Society to appear less ceremoniously loyal. His account to us was:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, I found that the Academy and the Institute and
the rest of them were preparing addresses to the Queen, and so I went
to work too, and I prepared a most wonderful address. Instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the illuminated performances for such occasions, I took a dozen folio
sheets of my old Dutch paper. I had them bound by Zaehnsdorf.
First came the beautiful binding in yellow morocco and the inscription
to Her Majesty, every word just in the right place&mdash;most wonderful.
You opened it, and on the first page you found a beautiful little drawing
of the royal arms that I made myself; the second page, an etching of
Windsor, as though 'there's where you live!' On the third page the
address began. I made decorations all round the text in water-colour,
at the top the towers of Windsor, down one side a great battleship
plunging through the waves, and below, the sun that never sets on the
British Empire&mdash;What? The following pages were not decorated,
just the most wonderful address, explaining the age and dignity of the
Society, its devotion to Her Glorious, Gracious Majesty, and suggesting
the honour it would be if this could be recognised by a title that would
show the Society to belong specially to Her. Then, the last page; you
turned, and there was a little etching of my house at Chelsea&mdash;'And
now, here's where I live!' And then you closed it, and at the back
of the cover was the Butterfly. This was all done and well on its way
and not a word was said to the Society, when the Committee wrote and
asked me if I would come to a meeting as they wished to consult me.
It was about an address to Her Majesty&mdash;all the other Societies were
sending them&mdash;and they thought they should too. I asked what they
proposed spending&mdash;they were aghast when I suggested that the guinea
they mentioned might not meet a twentieth of the cost. But, all the
time, my beautiful address was on its way to Windsor, and finally came
the Queen's acknowledgment and command that the Society should
be called Royal&mdash;I carried this to a meeting and it was stormy. One
member got up and protested against one thing and another, and
declared his intention of resigning. 'You had better make a note of
it, Mr. Secretary,' I said. And then I got up with great solemnity,
and I announced the honour conferred upon them by Her Gracious
Majesty, and they jumped up and they rushed towards me with outstretched
hands. But I waved them all off, and I continued with the
ceremonial to which they objected. For the ceremonial was one of
their grievances. They were accustomed to meet in shirt-sleeves&mdash;free-and-easy
fashion which I would not stand. Nor would I consent
to what was the rule and tradition of the Society. I would not, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
I spoke, step down from the chair and stand up in the body of the
meeting, but I remained always where I was. But, the meeting over,
then I sent for champagne."</p>

<p>Whistler, as President of the British Artists, was invited to the
Jubilee ceremonies in Westminster Abbey, and in Mr. Lorimer's painting
he may be seen on one side of the triforium, Leighton on the other.
<i>Jubilee in the Abbey</i>, an etching, gives his impressions. He was asked
also to the State garden-party at Buckingham Palace, and to the Naval
Review off Spithead, when he made the <i>Naval Review</i> series of plates
and at least one water-colour in a day. Naturally, when the Royal
Academy neglected to invite him to their <i>soirée</i>, though hitherto they
had always invited the President of the British Artists, he resented it
as an insult not only to himself, but to the Society. "It really was a
pretty little recognition of my own personality beneath the cloak of
office," he wrote in an often-quoted letter to Leighton, then President of
the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>The year before, Mr. Ayerst Ingram had proposed that the Society
should give a show of the President's work to precede their Summer
Exhibition of 1887. This had met with so many objections that
though the motion was not withdrawn as Whistler wanted, it was
dropped. After the new honours were obtained by him for the Society,
and while he was travelling in Belgium and Holland, an effort was made
to revive the scheme. Mr. Ingram did what he could. Mr. Walter
Dowdeswell acted as honorary secretary, guarantors were found, owners
of pictures were written to. February and March 1888 was the time
appointed, but Whistler doubted the sincerity of the Society and would
not risk anything less than an "absolute triumph of perfection" for an
undertaking made in the name of the British Artists or his own. To
him no success was worse than failure. At the end of September
nothing definite had been arranged, and Whistler told Mr. Ingram
that his "solitary evidence of active interest could hardly bring about
a result sufficient to excuse such an eleventh-hour effort."</p>

<p>He was right. The opposition in the Society was strong, and many
members were in open warfare with their President. They refused
to support him in his proposition that no member of the Society should
be, or should remain, a member of any other Society, and when he followed
this with the proposition that no member of the Royal Society of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
British Artists who was a member of any other Society should serve
on the Selecting or Hanging Committee, they again defeated him.
Nor did they persuade him to reconsider the formal withdrawal, on
November 18, of his permission to show his works. He sent, however,
several water-colours and the twelve etchings of the <i>Naval Review</i> to
the Winter Exhibition (1887-88), and four lithographs from the <i>Art
Notes</i> published that autumn by the Goupils. They were described
in the <i>Magazine of Art</i> (December 1887) as mere lead pencil "notes
reproduced in marvellous <i>facsimile</i>," which gave Whistler his chance
for a courteous reminder in the <i>World</i> to "the bewildered one."
The critic might inquire, he said; "the safe and well-conducted
one informs himself." Within the Society he had once more
to contend against the opposition to his hanging and spacing, and
a fresh grievance was that space was filled with the work of Monet,
as yet hardly known in England. One of the older members, when he
looked at Whistler's <i>Red Note</i>, declared, "If he can do that, I'll forgive
him&mdash;he can do anything." But few could forgive so easily. They
objected that "Whistler would have his way, and didn't mind if he
made enemies in getting it," and they began to whisper that in the
matter of the memorial he had been dictatorial. The situation is best
described in the words of Mr. Holmes to us: "With a little more of
Disraeli and a little less of Oliver Cromwell, Whistler would have
triumphed."</p>

<p>The crisis came in April 1888, before the Summer Exhibition. It
was suggested that the Council communicate with the President as to
the removal of temporary decorations which he had designed and they
had paid for. One decoration the Society did not object to was a
velarium, since it meant no loss of wall-space, and when Whistler removed
this they ordered a new one. Whistler, through his secretary, explained
to the Committee that the velarium was his patent&mdash;"a patent
taken out by the Greeks and Romans" is Mr. Ingram's comment.
Whistler got out an injunction; when the Committee, with their order
for the velarium, hurried to Hampton's shop, his secretary was at their
heels in a hansom with the injunction; the secretary arrived with them
at Liberty's, but somehow they managed, in the end, to evade him. A
velarium was made and put up, and they proceeded to get rid of their
President. At a meeting on May 7 a letter, signed by eight members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
whose names do not appear in the minutes, was read, asking President
Whistler to call a meeting to request Mr. James A. McNeill Whistler
to resign his membership in the Society, and he called the meeting and
signed the minutes. The President made a speech, in which he claimed
that his action in the matter of the velarium was not inimical to the
welfare of the Society, but the speech was not recorded. He permitted
no one to speak in opposition, and the subject was dropped. At the
special meeting called by him the same month there was an exhaustive
discussion. Whistler declared his position. His opponents presented
an array of lawyer's letters, which they said showed that Whistler had
threatened injunctions, had greatly impeded the Executive in the
decoration of the galleries, and had influenced many distinguished
people to keep away from the private view. A vote was taken for his
expulsion, though Mr. Ingram proposed a vote of censure in its place.
Whistler refused at first to put the motion to expel himself, but finally
was compelled to do so. There were eighteen votes for, nineteen against
it, and nine members did not vote. The votes, Whistler said, when he
addressed the meeting after the ballot, showed that the Society approved
of his action. Mr. Francis James at once proposed a vote of
censure on those who had signed the letter, but this was not carried.
On June 4, at the annual election, when a whip had been sent round to
all members, Wyke Bayliss was elected President, and Whistler resigned
from the Society, congratulating the members on the election: "Now,
at last, you must be satisfied. You can no longer say you have the
right man in the wrong place!"</p>

<p>Mr. Starr recalls his saying: "Now I understand the feelings of all
those who, since the world began, have tried to save their fellow men."</p>

<p>The minority resigned, as Mr. Menpes, foreseeing the inevitable,
had a month earlier, which led to Whistler's comment on "the early
rat who leaves the sinking ship." All who had joined the Society with
him left it with him, and he said "the Artists came out and the British
remained."</p>

<p>Mr. Menpes describes a supper of the Artists after the meeting
at the Hogarth Club. He says he was taken back into favour, and
joined the party. "What are you going to do with them all?" he
asked. "Lose them," said Whistler. But he did not lose them all.
One or two stayed by him to the end.</p>

<p>Whistler, according to the constitution, held office till December,
and till December he retained his post. During this time there were
meetings. At one he addressed Bayliss as Baily&mdash;to his disgust&mdash;but,
on this occasion at least, Bayliss had an idea and replied, "Yes,
Mr. Whistle!" At a meeting on November 28 Whistler made a
statement of his relations with the Society, and his objects and aims
concerning it, only referred to in the minutes, and he gave up the chair
to Wyke Bayliss. He had been President two years, a member four.
After November 28, 1888, his name appears in the official records only
twice: first on January 4, 1889, in connection with a dispute over
the notice board outside the gallery, and then on July 20, 1903, when
Wyke Bayliss stated "that, acting on the feeling that it would be the
wish of the Society, he had ordered a wreath to be sent in the name
of the Society on the occasion of the funeral of Mr. Whistler."</p>

<p>The newspapers were not so shy of the President as the minute-books.
The difference between Whistler and the Society found the
publicity which he could never escape. He said to the men who resigned
with him, "Come and make history for posterity," and, as usual, he saw
that the record was accurate. He had hardly left the Society when the
notice board, with the Butterfly and the lion which he had painted,
was altered; he immediately wrote a letter to state the fact in the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. Reporters and interviewers gave the British
Artists' reasons for their late President's resignation and his successor's
qualifications for the post. Whistler lost no time in explaining his
position and giving his estimate of the new President. It cannot be
said too often that his letters to the Press, criticised as trivial and undignified,
were written deliberately that "history might be made."
Many pages of <i>The Gentle Art</i> are filled with his relations with the
British Artists. The gaiety of his letters was mistaken for flippancy,
because the more solemn and ponderous the "enemies" became, the
more "joyous" he grew in disposing of them. He did not spare the
British Artists. The <i>Pall Mall</i> undertook to describe the disaster of
the "Whistlerian policy" in Suffolk Street by statistics and to extol the
strength of Wyke Bayliss:</p>

<p>"The sales of the Society during the year 1881 were under five
thousand pounds; 1882, under six thousand; 1883, under seven
thousand; 1884, under eight thousand; 1885 (the first year of Mr.

Whistler's rule), they fell to under four thousand; 1885, under three
thousand; 1887, under two thousand; and the present year, 1888,
under one thousand.... The new President ... is ... the hero
of three Bond Street 'one-man exhibitions,' a board-school chairman, a
lecturer, champion chess-player of Surrey, a member of the Rochester
Diocesan Council, a Shakespearean student, a Fellow of the Society of
Cyclists, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquarians, and public orator
of Noviomagus."</p>

<p>Whistler's answer, serious in intention, gay in wording, pointed
out "the, for once, not unamusing 'fact' that the disastrous and simple
Painter Whistler only took in hand the reins of government at least
a year after the former driver had been pitched from his box and half
the money-bags had been already lost! From eight thousand to four
thousand at one fatal swoop! and the beginning of the end had set
in!...  'Four thousand pounds!' down it went; three thousand
pounds, two thousand pounds&mdash;the figures are Wyke's&mdash;and this
season, the ignominious 'one thousand pounds or under' is none of my
booking! And when last I saw the mad machine it was still cycling
down the hill."</p>

<p>Whistler was disappointed, though he did not show it. He was
seldom invited to join anything, nor did he rush to accept the rare
invitation. He would take no part in the Art Congress started in the
eighties, despite an effort to entangle him; he would do no more than
"bestow his benison" upon the movement in 1886 to organise a National
Art Exhibition, led by Walter Crane, Holman Hunt, and George
Clausen. But to the British Artists he had given his time and energy
during four years, he had dragged the Society out of the slough in
which it was floundering and made its exhibitions the most distinguished
and most talked-about in London. Wyke Bayliss, who never understood
him, wrote: "Whistler's purpose was to make the British Artists
a small, esoteric set; mine was to make it a great guild of the working
artists of this country."</p>

<p>Whistler said: "I wanted to make the British Artists an art centre;
they wanted to remain a shop."</p>

<p>Wyke Bayliss and his successor were knighted, as Presidents of
Royal Societies usually are; Whistler, who obtained the title and
charter of the Society, was ignored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten years later, as President of the International Society of Sculptors,
Painters, and Gravers, he not only recommended, but carried out
his schemes and theories: the decoration of the galleries, the refusal of
bad work no matter who sent it, the proper hanging of the pictures
accepted, the making of the exhibitions into artistic events, the interesting
of the public in them, the insistence that each artist should only
support his own Society's exhibitions and should belong to no other
Society. He was dictatorial, but without a dictator nothing can be
done, and at the British Artists each British Artist wanted to lead.
His Presidency began in mistrust and ended in discord. For Whistler
it had an advantage, especially abroad, where artists began to regard
him with deference.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI: MARRIAGE.<br />THE YEAR EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY-EIGHT.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I don't</span> marry," Whistler said, "though I tolerate those who do."
But before he left the British Artists' he did marry. His wife was
Beatrix Godwin, widow of E. W. Godwin, the architect of the White
House and for years Whistler's champion in the Press. Godwin died
on October 6, 1886, and Whistler married on August 11, 1888.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whistler was the daughter of John Birnie Philip, remembered
as one of the sculptors who worked on the awful Albert Memorial.
She was large, so that Whistler was dwarfed beside her, dark and handsome,
more foreign in appearance, but not in person, than English.
Whistler delighted in a tradition that there was gipsy blood in her
family. She had studied art in Paris and with him, and he was proud
of her as a pupil. Her work included several decorative designs, and
a series of etchings made to illustrate the English edition of Van Eeden's
<i>Little Johannes</i>. Only a few of the plates were finished, and of these
some proofs were shown in the first exhibition of the International
Society and in the Paris Memorial Exhibition, while Mr. Heinemann
had the intention of publishing a series of illustrations which she and
Whistler drew on the wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere held himself responsible for the marriage, and
told the story in <i>Truth</i> (July 23, 1903):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe that I am responsible for his marriage to the widow
of Mr. Godwin, the architect. She was a remarkably pretty woman
and very agreeable, and both she and he were thorough Bohemians.
I was dining with them and some others one evening at Earl's Court.
They were obviously greatly attracted to each other, and in a vague
sort of way they thought of marrying. So I took the matter in hand
to bring things to a practical point. 'Jemmy,' I said, 'will you marry
Mrs. Godwin?' 'Certainly,' he replied. 'Mrs. Godwin,' I said,
'will you marry Jemmy?' 'Certainly,' she replied. 'When?' I
asked. 'Oh, some day,' said Whistler. 'That won't do,' I said,
'we must have a date.' So they both agreed that I should choose the
day, what church to come to for the ceremony, provide the clergyman,
and give the bride away. I fixed an early date, and got the then
Chaplain of the House of Commons [the Rev. Mr. Byng] to perform
the ceremony. It took place a few days later.</p>

<p>"After the ceremony was over, we adjourned to Whistler's studio,
where he had prepared a banquet. The banquet was on the table,
but there were no chairs. So we sat on packing-cases. The happy
pair, when I left, had not quite decided whether they would go that
evening to Paris or remain in the studio. How unpractical they were
was shown when I happened to meet the bride the day before the
marriage in the street:</p>

<p>"'Don't forget to-morrow,' I said. 'No,' she replied, 'I am
just going to buy my trousseau.' 'A little late for that, is it not?'
I asked. 'No,' she answered, 'for I am only going to buy a new toothbrush
and a new sponge, as one ought to have new ones when one
marries.'"</p>

<p>The wedding took place at St. Mary Abbott's, Kensington, in the
presence of Dr. and Mrs. Whistler, one of Mrs. Godwin's sisters,
Mrs. Whibley, and three or four others. Mr. Labouchere gave the
bride away and Mr. Jopling-Rowe was best man. Whistler had recently
left 454 Fulham Road and the Vale, with its memories of Maud, for
the Tower House, Tite Street, and the suddenness of his marriage
gave no time to put things in order. There were not only packing-cases
in the dining-room&mdash;usually one of the first rooms furnished in
every house he moved into&mdash;but the household was in most respects
unprepared for the reception of a bride. The wedding breakfast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was ordered from the Café Royal, and the bride's sister hurriedly got
a wedding cake from Buszard's.</p>

<p>The rest of the summer and autumn was spent in France, part of
the time in Boulogne. Mr. and Mrs. Cole, on</p>

<p>"<i>August 27</i> (1888). Met Jimmy and his wife on the sands: they
came up with us to Rue de la Paix, down to bathe. Jimmy sketching
on sands; the W.'s turned up after lunch. With Jimmy to the iron
and rag <i>marché</i> near Boulevard Prince Albert [no doubt in search of
old paper as well as of subjects]. He sketched (water-colours) a dingy
shop. Later we dined with them at the Casino. Pleasant <i>parti à
quatre</i>. Jimmy in excellent form. Leaving to-morrow."</p>

<p>From Boulogne they went to Touraine, stopping at Chartres,
most of the time lost to their friends, as they intended to be lost. It
was Whistler's first holiday. He was taking it lazily, he wrote to Mrs.
William Whistler, in straw hat and white shoes, rejoicing in the grapes
and melons, getting the pleasure out of it that France always gave him.
But he got more than pleasure. He brought back to London about
thirty plates of Tours and Loches and Bourges, and settled down in
London to wind up his connection with the British Artists'.</p>

<p>Whistler was devoted to his wife, who henceforth occupied a far
more prominent position in his life than could have been imagined.
Indeed his life was entirely changed by his marriage. He went less
into society and had less time for his art. During months he was a
wanderer, and while he wandered his painting stopped. Not that
Mrs. Whistler was indifferent to art. She was sympathetic. He
liked to have her in the studio; when she could not come he brought
the pictures he was painting home for her to see. He consulted her
in his difficulties, she shared his troubles, she rejoiced in his triumphs.
But it cannot be denied that the period of great schemes came to an
end with his marriage. Although later he painted exquisite pictures,
there are no canvases like the <i>Mother</i> and <i>Carlyle</i>, the <i>Sarasate</i> and <i>The
Yellow Buskin</i>. This was no doubt the result partly of his pleasure
in his new domestic conditions, partly of circumstances that prevented
him from remaining long enough in one place for continuous work
to be possible. An artist must give himself entirely to his work, or
else have a very different temperament from Whistler's. After a
year or so in London and two or three happy years in Paris which Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Whistler said she did not deserve, her health necessitated wandering
again.</p>

<p>Commissions at last came, but Mrs. Whistler's illness left him no
chance to carry them out. He said to us one day: "Now, they want
these things; why didn't they want them twenty years ago, when I
wanted to do them, and could have done them? And they were just
as good twenty years ago as they are now."</p>

<p>Few large portraits begun during these years were completed.
And after his wife's death he struggled in vain to return to the old
conditions of continuous effort to which the world owes his greatest
masterpieces. It is true that his work never deteriorated till the
last, that, as he said, he brought it ever nearer to the perfection which
alone could satisfy him. He never produced anything finer in their
way than <i>The Master Smith</i> and <i>The Little Rose of Lyme Regis</i>, painted
towards the end of his married life, or the series of children's heads of
his latest years. But these were planned on a smaller scale and required
less physical effort than the large full-lengths and the decorative designs
he longed to execute, but was never able to finish, sometimes not even
to begin. Whistler, with advancing years, became more sure of himself,
more the master, but circumstances forced him to find his pleasure
and exercise his knowledge in smaller work.</p>

<div class="gaptop4"></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII:<br />THE WORK OF THE YEARS EIGHTEEN
EIGHTY TO EIGHTEEN NINETY-TWO.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> years were full, for though few large paintings were completed,
there were many small oils, water-colours, pastels, etchings, and
lithographs. Whistler, going and coming in England or on the
Continent, had trunks and bags with compartments for his colours,
plates, and lithographic materials. It is impossible to say, he did not
know, the exact number of small works he produced during this
period.</p>

<p>He had used water-colour since his schooldays, but, until he went
to Venice, not to any extent. Some of the Venetian drawings show
that he was then scarcely master of it. But the results he finally got,
both in figure and landscape, were admirable. He touched perfection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in many a little angry sea at Dieppe, or note in Holland, or impression
of Paris. As not many are dated it may never be known when this
mastery was reached. He probably would not have been sure of the
dates. We have gone through drawers of the cabinet in his studio
with him, when he expressed the utmost surprise on finding certain
things that he had forgotten, and was unable to say when they were
painted or drawn. He suffered from this confusion and realised the
importance of making a complete list of his works, with their dates
and there were various projects and commencements. After several
attempts he found it took too much time. We know that he asked
Mr. Freer to trace his pictures in America and Mr. D. Croal Thomson
to do the same in England. Miss Birnie Philip finally swore in the
Law Courts that what he wanted was for us to prepare a complete
catalogue.</p>

<p>Between 1880 and 1892 he made ninety plates in England. They
begin with <i>Regent's Quadrant</i>. Then follow little shops in Chelsea,
Gray's Inn, Westminster, the Wild West (Earl's Court), Whitechapel,
Sandwich, the Jubilee, and many figure subjects. There is also the
<i>Swan and Iris</i>, the copy of an unfinished picture by Cecil Lawson
for Mr. Edmund Gosse's <i>Memoir</i> of the painter (1883), another unsuccessful
attempt at reproduction. It was the only plate, since those
published by the Junior Etching Club, made as an illustration
<i>Billingsgate</i> was issued in the <i>Portfolio</i> (1878) and Hamerton's <i>Etching
and Etchers</i> (1880), <i>Alderney Street</i> in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>
(1881), <i>La Marchande de Moutarde</i> in <i>English Etchings</i> (1888), but
these were etched with no idea of their publication in magazine or
book.</p>

<p>The English plates are simple in subject, and they have been
therefore dismissed as unimportant by unimportant people. But
many are delightfully composed and full of observation. Whistler
carrying the small plates about with him, sketched on copper, with
the knowledge of a lifetime, the subjects he found as other artists sketch
on paper. Three etchings were made at the Wild West probably
in an afternoon; one at Westminster Abbey during the Jubilee Service
of 1887; and ten to thirteen of the Jubilee Naval Review in a day&mdash;plates
that prove triumphantly his power of giving his impressions
with a few lines of his etching-needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1887 he went to Belgium with Dr. and Mrs.
William Whistler, stopping at Brussels, Ostend, and Bruges. In Brussels
he etched the Hôtel de Ville, the Guildhalls, the little shops and streets
and courts, intending to issue the prints as a set. M. Octave Maus,
who knew him, says "he was enchanted with the picturesque and
disreputable quarter of <i>les Marolles</i> in the old town. He was frequently
to be met in the alleys which pour a squalid populace into the old
High Street, engaged in scratching on the copper his impressions of
the swarming life around him. When the inquisitive throng pressed
him too hard, the artist merely pointed his graver at the arm, or neck,
or cheek of one of the intruders. The threatening weapon, with his
sharp spiteful laugh, put them at once to flight."</p>

<p>Sometimes Dr. and Mrs. Whistler found him, safe out of the way
of the crowd, in the bandstand of the Grande Place, where several
of the plates were made. These are another development in technique.
With the fewest, the most delicate, lines he expressed the most complicated
and the most picturesque architecture. The plates were
probably bitten with little stopping-out, and they are printed with a
sharpness that shows their wonderful drawing. M. Duret has
said to us that in them Whistler gives "<i>les os de l'architecture</i>." A
very few proofs were pulled. The set was never issued.</p>

<p>The etchings described as in Touraine are those done on his wedding
journey and at other times. They also have never been published as a
set. As in Belgium, great architecture suggested his subjects, and his
treatment shows that if, as a rule, he refrained from rendering architecture,
it was from no desire to evade difficulties, as ignorant critics suppose.
The line is more vital and the biting more powerful than in the
Belgian plates.</p>

<p>The year after his marriage (1889) he etched seventeen plates in and
around Dordrecht and Amsterdam, including <i>Nocturne&mdash;Dance House</i>,
<i>The Embroidered Curtain</i>, <i>The Balcony</i>, <i>Zaandam</i>, in which he surpassed
Rembrandt in Rembrandt's subject. His success is the more surprising
because scarcely anywhere does the artist sketch under such difficulties
as in Holland. The little Dutch boys are the worst in the world,
and the grown people as bad. In Amsterdam, the women in the houses
on one of the canals, where Whistler worked in a boat, emptied buckets
of water out of the windows above him. He dodged in time, but had
to call on the police, and, he told us, the next interruption was a big
row above, and "I looked up, dodging the filthy pails, to see the women
vanishing backward being carried off to wherever they carry people
in Holland. After that, I had no more trouble, but I always had a
policeman whenever I had a boat."</p>

<p>In the Dutch plates he returned to the methods perfected at Venice
in <i>The Traghetto</i> and <i>The Beggars</i>. After he brought them back to
London he was interviewed on the subject in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>
(March 4, 1890), and is reported to have said:</p>

<p>"First you see me at work on the Thames. Now, there you see
the crude and hard detail of the beginner. So far, so good. There,
you see, all is sacrificed to exactitude of outline. Presently and almost
unconsciously I begin to criticise myself and to feel the craving of the
artist for form and colour. The result was the second stage, which
my enemies call inchoate and I call Impressionism. The third state
I have shown you. In that I have endeavoured to combine stages one
and two. You have the elaboration of the first stage and the quality
of the second."</p>

<p>Though we hesitate to accept the words as his, this is an interesting
statement and a suggestive description. In some of the Dutch plates
there is more detail than in the Venetian, and yet form is expressed
not by the detail of the Thames series but by line. No etcher had
got such fullness of colour without a mass of cross-hatching that takes
away from the freshness. It is interesting to contrast his distant
views of the town of Amsterdam and the windmills of Zaandam with
Rembrandt's etchings of the same subjects, and to note the greater
feeling of space and distance that Whistler gives. The work is more
elaborate and delicate than in previous plates, so delicate sometimes
that it seems underbitten. But his method necessitated this. He
drew with such minuteness that hardly any of the ground, the varnish,
was left on the plates, and when he bit them, he could only bite slightly
to prevent the modelling from being lost. He never had been so
successful in applying his scientific theories to etching, and rarely
more satisfied with the results. His first idea was to publish the prints
in a set, through the Fine Art Society, but the Fine Art Society were
so foolish as to refuse. A few were bought at once for the South
Kensington and Windsor Collections, and several were shown in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
spring of 1890 at Mr. Dunthorne's gallery. About this time we
returned to London, and J. commenced to write occasionally in the
London Press, succeeding Mr. George Bernard Shaw as art critic on
the <i>Star</i>. This is his impression, written when he saw them (April 8):</p>

<p>"I stepped in at Dunthorne's the other afternoon to have a look
at the etchings of Amsterdam by Mr. Whistler. There are only eight
of them, I think, but they are eight of the most exquisite renderings
by the most independent man of the century. With two exceptions
they are only studies of very undesirable lodgings and tenements on
canal banks, old crumbling brick houses reflected in sluggish canals,
balconies with figures leaning over them, clothes hanging in decorative
lines, a marvellously graceful figure carelessly standing in the great
water-door of an overhanging house, every figure filled with life and
movement, and all its character expressed in half a dozen lines. The
same houses, or others, at night, their windows illuminated and casting
long trailing reflections in the water, seemed to be singularly unsuccessful,
the plate being apparently underbitten or played out. At
any rate that was the impression produced on me. [We know now
and have explained the reason for this.] Another there was, of a
stretch of country looking across a canal, windmills beyond drawn
as no one since Rembrandt could have done it, and in his plate the
greatest of modern etchers has pitted himself against the greatest of
the ancients, and has come through only too successfully for Rembrandt.
There are three or four others, I understand, not yet published,
but this certainly is the gem so far. The last is a great drawbridge, with
a suggestion of trees and houses, figures and boats, and a tower in
the distance, done, I believe, from a canal in Amsterdam. This is
the fourth distinct series of etchings which Mr. Whistler has in the
last thirty or thirty-five years given the world: the early miscellaneous
French and English plates; the Thames series, valued by artists more
than by collectors, though even to the latter they are worth more
than their weight in gold; the Venetian plates; and now these;
and between while, portraits as full of character as Rembrandt's, studies
of London and Brussels, and I know not what else besides have come
from his ever busy needle. Had Mr. Whistler never put brush to
canvas, he has done enough in these plates to be able to say that
he will not altogether die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>That was J.'s opinion then, and he has not had to change it.
During 1890 Whistler made a large number of lithographs, excellently
catalogued by T. R. Way, who printed most of them and was, consequently,
qualified for the task. Three, <i>The Winged Hat</i>, <i>The Tyresmith</i>,
and <i>Maunder's Fish Shop, Chelsea</i>, were published this year in
the short-lived occasional weekly <i>The Whirlwind</i>, edited by Herbert
Vivian and Stuart Erskine "in the Legitimist cause" and to their
own great amusement. Drawings by Sidney Starr after three of
Whistler's pictures appeared, and the editors boasted in their own
pages within a few weeks that the lithographs, issued for a penny,
could be had only for five shillings. Five guineas would now be
nearer the price.</p>

<p>Another lithograph, <i>Chelsea Rags</i>, came out in the January number
(1892) of the <i>Albemarle</i>, a monthly edited by Hubert Crackanthorpe
and W. H. Wilkins, one of those gay experiments in periodical literature
no longer made in this sad land. The four were called <i>Songs on Stone</i>,
the later title for a proposed portfolio of lithographs in colour which
Mr. Heinemann announced but never issued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII: HONOURS. EXHIBITIONS. NEW
INTERESTS.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY-NINE TO
EIGHTEEN NINETY-ONE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Official</span> recognition of Whistler in England was followed by official
honours abroad. While President of the British Artists he was asked
for the first time to show in the International Exhibition at Munich
(1888). He sent <i>The Yellow Buskin</i> and was awarded a second-class
medal. The best comment was Whistler's letter of acknowledgment
to the Secretary, whom he prayed to convey to the Committee his
"sentiments of tempered and respectable joy" and "complete appreciation
of the second-hand compliment." But soon after he was
elected an Honorary Member of the Bavarian Royal Academy, and,
a year later, was given a first-class medal and the Cross of St. Michael.
In 1889 he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and received
a first-class medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition. Another gold
medal was awarded to him at Amsterdam, where he was showing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<i>Mother</i>, <i>The Fur Jacket</i>, and <i>Effie Deans&mdash;Arrangement in Yellow and
Grey</i>. We have heard that Israels and Mesdag, who were little in
sympathy with Whistler, objected to giving him a medal, but James
Maris insisted. The year before Mr. E. J. Van Wisselingh had bought
from Messrs. Dowdeswell <i>Effie Deans</i>, which he had seen in the Edinburgh
International Exhibition of 1886, though it was skied. He
sold it within a short time to Baron Van Lynden, of The Hague,
then making his collection, bequeathed by the Baroness Van Lynden
in 1900 to the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam. The picture is almost
the only one to which Whistler gave a literary title, except the pastel
<i>Annabel Lee</i>. <i>Effie Deans</i> is apparently a portrait of Maud, and it
belongs to the period of <i>The Fur Jacket</i> and <i>Rosa Corder</i>. The Butterfly
was added later. The painting was not signed when bought by Baron
Van Lynden, who, hearing from Van Wisselingh that Whistler was in
Holland, asked him to sign it. Whistler not only did so, but we believe
then added the quotation from the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i> written at
the bottom of the canvas: "She sunk her head upon her hand and
remained seemingly unconscious as a statue," the only inscription on
any of his paintings that we have seen. Walter Sickert says that it was
added by some one else, but as Whistler saw the picture in 1902 and
made no objection to it, Mr. Sickert's statement scarcely seems
correct.</p>

<p>Few things pleased Whistler more than the honours from Amsterdam,
Munich, and Paris. To celebrate the Bavarian medal and decoration
his friends gave him a dinner at the Criterion, May 1, 1889. Mr.
E. M. Underdown, Q.C., was in the chair, and Mr. W. C. Symons
hon. secretary. Two Royal Academicians, Sir W. Q. Orchardson and
Mr. Alfred Gilbert, were present, and also Sir Coutts Lindsay, Stuart
Wortley, Edmund Yates&mdash;Atlas, who never failed him&mdash;and many
others. Whistler was moved, and not ashamed to show it. Stuart
Wortley, in a speech, said that Whistler had influenced every artist
in England; Orchardson described him as "a true artist"; and this
time Atlas spoke, not only with the weight of the <i>World</i> on his shoulders,
but with praise and affection. Whistler began his speech with a laugh
at this "age of rapid results when remedies insist upon their diseases."
But his voice is said to have been full of emotion before the end:</p>

<p>"You must feel that, for me, it is no easy task to reply under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
conditions of which I have so little habit. We are all even too conscious
that mine has hitherto, I fear, been the gentle answer that sometimes
turneth not away wrath.... It has before now been borne in upon
me that in surroundings of antagonism I may have wrapped myself for
protection in a species of misunderstanding, as that other traveller
drew closer about him the folds of his cloak the more bitterly the winds
and the storm assailed him on his way. But, as with him, when the
sun shone upon him in his path, his cloak fell from his shoulders, so
I, in the warm glow of your friendship, throw from me all former
disguise, and, making no further attempt to hide my true feeling,
disclose to you my deep emotion at such unwonted testimony of affection
and faith."</p>

<p>This was the only public testimonial he ever received in England,
and one of the few public functions at which he assisted. He seldom
attended public dinners, those solemn feasts of funeral baked meats
by which "the Islander soothes his conscience and purchases public
approval." We remember that he did not appear at the first dinner
of the Society of Authors, where his place was beside ours&mdash;a dinner
given to American authors, at which Lowell presided. J. recalls an
artists' dinner at which Whistler was seated on one side of the chairman
and Charles Keene on the other. Some brilliant person had placed
Sir Frederick Wedmore next to Whistler, who had more fun at the
dinner than the critic. He rarely was seen in the City, and rarely was
asked in Paris. As an outsider, he was never invited to the Academy.
Even little private functions, like the Johnson Club, to which J.
has taken him, he did not care for. It is so easy to be bored, so
difficult to be amused, on such occasions. He preferred not to run the
risk.</p>

<p>Of gentle answers that turn not away wrath there were plenty
in 1889. At the Universal Exhibition in Paris, Whistler, an American,
naturally proposed to show with Americans. <i>The Yellow Buskin</i> and
<i>The Balcony</i> were the pictures he selected; he sent twenty-seven
etchings, knowing that, in a big exhibition, a few prints make no effect.
The official acknowledgment was a printed notice from General Rush
C. Hawkins, "Cavalry Officer," Commissioner for the American Art
Department: "Sir,&mdash;Ten of your exhibits have not received the
approval of the jury. Will you kindly remove them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Whistler's answer was an immediate journey to Paris, a call on
General Hawkins, the withdrawal of all his prints and pictures, to
the General's embarrassment. Whistler wrote afterwards to the <i>New
York Herald</i>, Paris edition: "Had I been properly advised that the
room was less than the demand for place, I would, of course, have
instantly begged the gentlemen of the jury to choose, from among
the number, what etchings they pleased."</p>

<p>Twenty-seven etchings, unless specially invited, were rather a large
number to send to any exhibition. He had been already asked to
contribute to the British Section, and to it he now took the two pictures
and ten prints. Though General Hawkins' action is as incomprehensible
as his appointment to such a post, Whistler made a mistake. There
is no doubt that, had his seventeen accepted prints remained in the
American Section, he would have had a much better show than in the
English, where only ten were hung and where, for etching, Seymour
Haden, and not Whistler, was awarded a <i>Grand Prix</i>. "Whistler's
Grievance" got into the papers, and the letters and interviews remain
in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. If in 1889 he identified himself with the British,
it was due solely to the discourtesy, as he considered it, of his countrymen.
There was no denial of his nationality, and, though later always
invited to show in the British Section of International Exhibitions,
he always refused when there was an American Section.</p>

<p>In 1888 the New Gallery took over the played-out traditions of
the Grosvenor, but Whistler did not follow to Regent Street. His
<i>Carlyle</i>, several drawings, and many etchings went to the Glasgow
International Exhibition that year, and he was well represented at
the first show of the Pastel Society at the Grosvenor. He was more
in sympathy with the New English Art Club than any other group of
artists. It was then youthful and enthusiastic, most of the younger
men of promise or talent belonged, and it might have accomplished
great things had its founders been faithful to their original ambition.
Whistler was never a member, but he sent a <i>White Note</i> and the etching
of the <i>Grande Place, Brussels</i>, to the exhibition in 1888, and <i>Rose and
Red</i>, a pastel, in 1889, when he was elected by the votes of the exhibitors
to the jury. To the infinite loss of the club he never showed again.
In the same year (1889), at the Institute of the Fine Arts at Glasgow,
the <i>Mother</i> strengthened the impression made by the <i>Carlyle</i> the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
before; there was a show of his work in May at the College of Working
Women in Queen Square, London; and <i>The Grey Lady</i> was included
in an exhibition at the Art Institution, Chicago, in the fall.</p>

<p>The show at Queen Square was remarkable. It is said to have been
"organised by Mr. Walter Sickert, by permission of Miss Goold (head
of the College), and opened by Lord Halsbury." There had not been
such a representative collection of his work since his exhibition of
1874. The <i>Mother</i>, <i>Carlyle</i>, <i>Rosa Corder</i>, <i>Irving</i> were there, many
pastels and water-colours, and many etchings of all periods from the
Thames Series to the last in Touraine and Belgium. We have never
seen a catalogue. We remember how it impressed us when we came
to the fine Queen Anne house in the quiet, out-of-the-way square,
how indignant we were to find nobody but a solitary man and a
young lady at the desk, and how urgently we wrote in the <i>Star</i> that,
"if there were as many as half a dozen people who cared for good
work, they should go at once to see this exhibition of the man who
has done more to influence artists than any modern." There is
a legend of Whistler's coming one day, taking a picture from the
wall and walking away with it, despite the protest of the attendant
and the Principal of the College, wishing, so the legend goes, to
carry out the theory he was soon to assert that pictures were only
"kindly lent their owners." But the story of his making off with
it across the square, followed by the college staff screaming "Stop
thief!" and being nearly run in by a policeman, is a poor invention.
His desire, however, to keep his pictures in his possession, his hope that
those who bought them would not dispose of them, was growing, and
his disgust when they were sold, especially at increased prices, was
expressed in his answer to some one who said, "Staats Forbes tells me
that that picture of yours he has will be the last picture he will ever
part with." "H'm," said Whistler, who had had later news, "it is the
last picture he has."</p>

<p>In March 1890 Whistler moved to No. 21 Cheyne Walk, an old
house with a garden at the back, farther down the Embankment,
close to Rossetti's Tudor House. It was panelled from the street door
to the top. A cool scheme of blue and white decorated the dining-room,
where there was one perfect painting over the mantel, and,
Mr. Francis James has told us, the <i>Six Projects</i> hung for a while on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
walls. The drawing-room on the first floor was turned into a studio,
there was a bedroom above, but the rest of the house was empty and
bare. From M. Gérard Harry we have an explanation of this bareness:</p>

<p>"I remember a striking remark of Whistler's at a garden-party
in his Chelsea house. As he caught me observing some incompletely
furnished rooms and questioning within myself whether he had occupied
the house more than a fortnight or so: 'You see,' he said, with his
short laugh, 'I do not care for definitely settling down anywhere.
Where there is no more space for improvement, or dreaming about
improvement, where mystery is in perfect shape, it is <i>finis</i>&mdash;the end&mdash;death.
There is no hope, nor outlook left.' I do not vouch for the
words, but that was certainly the sense of a remark which struck me
as offering a key to much of Whistler's philosophy, and to one aspect
of his original art."</p>

<p>On September 24, 1890, Mr. Cole, calling at Cheyne Walk, "found
him painting some excellent portraits&mdash;very strong and fine." What
all these were it is difficult to say, though one was the well-known
<i>Harmony in Black and Gold&mdash;Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac</i>,
Whistler's fourth portrait of a man in evening dress. Another may
have been the second portrait never finished, which Montesquiou
described to Edmond de Goncourt, who made a note of it in his <i>Journal</i>
(July 7, 1891):</p>

<p>"Montesquiou tells me that Whistler is now doing two portraits
of him: one is in evening dress, with a fur cloak over his arm, the other
in a great grey cloak with a high collar, and, just suggested, a necktie
of a mauve not to be put into words, though his eyes express the colour
of it. And Montesquiou is most interesting to listen to as he explains
the method of painting of Whistler, to whom he gave seventeen sittings
during the month spent in London. The first sketch-in of his subject
is with Whistler a fury, a passion: one or two hours of this wild fever
and the subject emerges complete in its envelope. Then sittings,
long sittings, when, most of the time, the brush is brought close to the
canvas but does not touch it, is thrown away, and another taken, and
sometimes in three hours not more than fifty touches are given to the
canvas, every touch, according to Whistler, lifting a veil from the
sketch.</p>

<p>"Oh, sittings! when it seemed to Montesquiou that Whistler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
by that intentness of observation, was draining from him his life,
something of his individuality, and, in the end, he was so exhausted
that he felt as if all his being was shrinking away, but happily he
discovered a certain <i>vin de coca</i> that restored him after those terrible
sittings."</p>

<p>J. went only once to No. 21 Cheyne Walk. Then it was to consult
Whistler concerning Sir Hubert von Herkomer's publication of photogravures
of pen-drawings in <i>An Idyl</i>, and description of them as etchings.
Whistler received J. in the white-panelled dining-room, where he
was breakfasting on an egg. Sickert came in and was at once sent out&mdash;with
a letter. Whistler felt the seriousness of the offence, and he lent
his support to W. E. Henley's <i>National Observer</i>, in which the affair
was exposed and in which also the Queen was called upon to remove
Herkomer from his post as Slade Professor at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>From this time J. saw Whistler oftener, meeting him in clubs,
in galleries, in friends' houses, occasionally at Solferino's, the little
restaurant in Rupert Street which was for several years the meeting-place,
a club really, for the staff of the <i>National Observer</i>. Nobody
who ever lunched there on Press day at the Academy, or the New
English Art Club, or the New Gallery is likely to forget the talk round
the table in the corner. Never have we heard R. A. M.&mdash;"Bob"&mdash;Stevenson
more brilliant, more paradoxical, more inspiriting than
at these midday gatherings. Whistler's first encounter with Henley's
paper, then edited in Edinburgh, was a sharp skirmish which, though
he afterwards became friendly with Henley, he never forgot nor forgave.
Henley was publishing a series of articles called <i>Modern Men</i>, among
whom he included Whistler, "the Yankee with the methods of Barnum."
The policy of the <i>National Observer</i> was to fight, everybody, everything,
and it fought with spirit. But it had no patience with the battles
of others. Of Whistler the artist it approved, but not of Whistler
the writer of letters, whom it pronounced rowdy and unpleasant.
"Malvolio-Macaire" was its name for him. At last, in noticing
Sheridan Ford's <i>Gentle Art</i>, of which we shall presently have more
to say, it continued in the same strain, and a copy of the paper containing
the review, "with proud mark, in the blue pencil of office,"
was sent to Whistler. He answered with a laugh at "the thick thumb
of your editorial refinement" pointed "in deprecation of my choice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
rowdyism." Two things came of the letter&mdash;one amusing, the other
a better understanding. Whistler's answer finished with a "regret
that the ridiculous 'Romeike' has not hitherto sent me your agreeable
literature." Romeike objected; he had sent eight hundred and seven
clippings to Whistler: he demanded an apology. Whistler gave it
without hesitation: he had never thought of Romeike as a person,
and he wrote, "if it be not actionable permit me to say that you really
are delightful!!" No one could appreciate the wit, the fun of it
all better than Henley, and he was the more eager to meet Whistler.
His account of the meeting, when it came about, was coloured by the
enthusiasm that made Henley the stimulating person he was. "And
we met," he would say, throwing back his great head and laughing
with joy, though he gave no details of the meeting. Henley managed
to find "the earnest of romance" in everything that happened to him.
"And there we were&mdash;Whistler and I&mdash;together!" he would repeat,
as if it were the most dramatic situation that could be imagined.</p>

<p>The bond between them was their love of the Thames. Henley
was the first to sing the beauty of the river that Whistler was the
first to paint, and when he wrote the verses (<i>No. XIII.</i> in <i>Rhymes and
Rhythms</i>) that give the feeling, the magical charm of the Nocturnes,
he dedicated them to Whistler. Big and splendid as a Viking, exuberant,
emphatic, Henley was not the type physically to interest Whistler.
The sketch of him (made in 1896) is one of Whistler's least satisfactory
lithographs, and only six impressions were pulled. But their relations
were cordial, and when the <i>National Observer</i> was transferred to London
and Henley returned with it, Whistler sometimes came to the dinners
of the staff at Solferino's. Henley had gathered about him the younger
literary men and journalists: Rudyard Kipling, "Bob" Stevenson,
J. M. Barrie, Marriott Watson, G. S. Street, Vernon Blackburn, Fitzmaurice
Kelly, Arthur Morrison, Charles Whibley, Kenneth Grahame,
George W. Steevens. After Mr. Astor bought the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>
its staff was largely recruited from the <i>National Observer</i>, and Mr.
Henry Cust, the editor, and Mr. Ivan-Muller, the assistant editor, joined
the group in the room upstairs. When dinner was over and Henley
was thundering at his end of the table, the rest listening, Whistler
sometimes dropped in, and the contrast between him and Henley
added to the gaiety of the evening: Henley, the "Burly" of Stevenson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
essay on <i>Talk and Talkers</i>, "who would roar you down ... bury
his face in his hands ... undergo passions of revolt and agony";
Whistler, who would find the telling word, let fly the shaft of wit
that his eloquent hands emphasised with delicate, graceful gesture.
His "Ha ha!" rose above Henley's boisterous intolerance. When
"Bob" Stevenson was there&mdash;"Spring-Heel'd Jack"&mdash;the entertainment
was complete. But each of the three talked his best when
he held the floor, and we have known Whistler more brilliant when
dining alone with us. From Solferino's, at a late hour when Henley,
as always in his lameness, had been helped to his cab, Whistler and J.
would retire with "Bob" Stevenson and a little group to the Savile,
where everything under heaven was discussed by them, Professor
Walter Raleigh, Reginald Blomfield, and Charles Furse frequently
joining them, and they rarely left until the club was closed. Whistler
would, in his turn, be seen to his cab on his way home, and a smaller
group would listen to "Bob" between Piccadilly and Westminster
Bridge, waiting for him to catch the first morning train to Kew.</p>

<p>Whistler seldom left without some parting shot which his friends
remembered, though he was apparently unconscious of the effects of
these bewildering little sayings as he returned to his house in Cheyne
Walk. There he was often followed by his new friends and often visited
by the few "artists" he had not cared to lose, especially Mr. Francis
James and Mr. Theodore Roussel. A few Followers continued to
flutter at his heels. Portraits of some of those who came to 21 Cheyne
Walk are in the lithograph of <i>The Garden</i>: Mr. Walter Sickert, Mr.
Sidney Starr, Mr. and Mrs. Brandon Thomas. Mr. Walter Sickert
had married Miss Ellen Cobden, and she was a constant visitor. So
also were Henry Harland, later editor of the <i>Yellow Book</i>, and Mrs.
Harland; Wolcot Balestier, the enterprising youth who set out to
corner the literature of the world, and who, with Mr. S. S. McClure,
was bent on syndicating everybody, including Whistler; Miss Carrie
Balestier, now Mrs. Rudyard Kipling; an American journalist called
Haxton, with a stammer that Whistler adored to the point of borrowing
it on occasions, though he never could manage the last stage when
words that refused to be spoken had to be spelled. Another was
André Raffalovitch, a Russian youth and poet, whose receptions
brought together many amusing as well as fantastic elements of London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
society. But the most intimate friend he made at this period was Mr.
William Heinemann, and this brings us to the great event of 1890, the
publication of <i>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV: "THE GENTLE ART."<br />THE YEAR
EIGHTEEN NINETY.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> years Whistler's letters to the papers puzzled the people. George
Moore laboured to account for them in <i>Modern Painting</i> by an elaborate
theory of physical feebleness, and George Moore has been taken seriously
in the provinces and America. One glimpse of Whistler at the printing-press,
sleeves rolled up showing two strong arms, and the theory and
the theorist would have been knocked out. The letters were not an
eccentricity; they were not a weakness. From the first, written
to the <i>Athenæum</i> in 1862, they had one aim, "to make history."
Buried in the papers, they were lost; if the history were to be made
they must be collected. They were collected and edited as <i>The Gentle
Art of Making Enemies as Pleasingly Exemplified in Many Instances,
Wherein the Serious Ones of this Earth, Carefully Exasperated, Have
Been Prettily Spurred on to Unseemliness and Indiscretion, While Overcome
by an Undue Sense of Right</i>.</p>

<p>The book, born of years of fighting, was ushered into the world by
a fight. The work of collecting and arranging the letters was undertaken
by Mr. Sheridan Ford, an American journalist in London.
Whistler said that Ford only helped him. Ford said that the idea was
his, that he, with Whistler's approval, was collecting and editing the
letters for a publication of his own. We give Ford's story and that of
one who followed it at the time, Mr. J. McLure Hamilton, and this we
are better pleased to do because Whistler misunderstood Mr. Hamilton's
part in the matter, and credited him with a malice and enmity that
few men could be so incapable of as he. Whistler would never consent
to meet him and could not understand why we should not agree in
his view of Mr. Hamilton as "a dangerous person." By accident
they did meet in our flat. Whistler was dining with us, Mr. and Mrs.
Hamilton called in the evening. Other people were there, and they
simply ignored one another; chance had blundered in its choice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the moment for the meeting. We think Whistler would have felt
the unfairness of his judgment of Mr. Hamilton's conduct could he
have read Mr. Hamilton's version which he has sent us:</p>

<p>"In the spring of 1889 I met Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan Ford.
Sheridan Ford was writing for the <i>New York Herald</i>, and Mrs. Sheridan
Ford had been interesting picture-dealers in the work of Swan, Clausen,
Melville, and others. Ford had a very strong taste for art, and seemed
to be opposed to all forms of trickery, and was engaged on a series of
articles which appeared in the <i>New York Herald</i>, London edition,
upon Whistler and his work. He was also the author of <i>Art, a Commodity</i>,
a pamphlet widely read both in England and America. He
came to me one day, and told me of an idea that he thought could be
carried out with advantage to himself and Whistler. He suggested
that the letters which Whistler had been publishing from time to
time in the Press should be published in book form. The title was to
be <i>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</i>, and was, I understood, Ford's.
Whistler and he had talked the matter over, and it was agreed between
them that Ford should collect the letters, edit them with remarks of his
own, and publish the book for his own profit.</p>

<p>"The work went on for some months, and occasionally Ford would
bring me letters that he had unearthed from the newspaper files at
the British Museum to read. I was not acquainted with Whistler,
but from what Ford told me I understood that Whistler was as much
interested in the progress of the book as Ford. The latter seemed
to be looking forward with great eagerness to the production of a book
which could not fail to amuse the art world.</p>

<p>"One morning Ford came to me at Alpha House in great distress.
He brought with him a letter from Whistler requesting him to discontinue
the making of the book, and containing a cheque for ten
pounds in payment for the trouble that he had had in collecting the
materials. The book at that time was almost complete, and the preface
written. After a prolonged talk with him upon all the bearings of
the case, I concluded that Whistler's change of mind had been determined
by the discovery that there would be too much credit and profit
lost to him if he allowed Ford to bring out the work, and that probably
Mrs. Whistler had suggested to Whistler that it would be a great gain
to him if he were to issue the letters himself. Ford asked me what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
I would advise him to do. I replied that I personally would not
go on with the book, but that if he were careful to omit <i>all copyright
matter</i> he would be perfectly justified in continuing, after having,
of course, returned the cheque to Whistler. I have no doubt that
Ford asked the advice of others, for soon he brought me the advance
proofs to read, and I spent a great deal of time going over them,
sometimes suggesting alterations and improvements. A note from
Ford reached me telling me that the book was finished, and asking
my permission to dedicate it to me. I wrote, in reply, that I did
not wish the work dedicated to me. Ford found a good publisher
who was willing to undertake the publication of the work, and, as far
as I could see, everything was going on satisfactorily, when one morning
Ford called to see me and told me that Whistler had discovered the
printer and had threatened to proceed against him if he did not immediately
destroy the sheets, and he (Whistler) found and seized the
first sewn-up copy (or leaves) with my name on the dedication page,
in spite of the refusal I had given.</p>

<p>[The dedication was as follows: "Dedicated to John McLure
Hamilton, A Great Painter and a Charming Comrade. In Memory
of Many Pleasant Days." The proposed title was <i>The Gentle Art of
Making Enemies. J. McNeill Whistler as the Unattached Writer.
With Some Whistler Stories Old and New. Edited by Sheridan Ford.
Brentano's. London, Paris, New York, Washington, Chicago, 1890</i>.
Both dedication and title we have seen in Ford's handwriting.]</p>

<p>"This brought at once a letter from Whistler to me, in which
he abruptly accused me of assisting Ford in wronging him. I replied
in a few words denying his allegations. At this interview Ford's manner
was strange, and for several weeks after he was confined to his house,
a natural consequence of seeing all his hopes shattered. He had
foreseen in the successful production of <i>The Gentle Art of Making
Enemies</i> the opening of a happy and profitable career in letters. After
his recovery Mr. and Mrs. Ford went away, pursued by the relentless
activity of Whistler. In the end, the so-called 'pirated edition,'
paper-bound, appeared in Mechlin or some other Continental city
and was more or less clandestinely offered for sale in England. Whistler's
handsome volume appeared almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>"While these incidents were progressing, I was asked to dine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
at the Hogarth Club, and it had evidently been prearranged that
I should meet Whistler after dinner in the smoking-room. This was
my first introduction to the great master. We talked Art and commonplace,
but he never touched upon the subject of the book, and as I
was quite sure the meeting had been arranged in order that he might
discuss with me Ford's conduct, I could not understand his silence.
Our next meeting was at a <i>conversazione</i> held at the Grosvenor Galleries,
when we both freely discussed together the whole question before
Melville, who was displeased at the attitude I took with Whistler.
I frankly told him that I thought he had done Ford a great wrong in
withdrawing the editorship of the book which rightly belonged to
him."</p>

<p>Sheridan Ford, persisting that Whistler had conferred on him
the right to publish the collection, announced the simultaneous publication
of his book in England and America. The English publishers,
Messrs. Field and Tuer, of the Leadenhall Press, supposed that Ford
was acting for Whistler when he brought them the MS., which at
that time is said to have been called <i>The Correspondence of James
McNeill Whistler</i>. The text was set up and cast, the type distributed;
they were ready to print when they discovered their mistake. "We
then sent for the person in question," they wrote to Messrs. Lewis
and Lewis, Whistler's solicitors, "and told him that until he obtained
Mr. Whistler's sanction, we declined to proceed further with the
work."</p>

<p>Sheridan Ford went to Antwerp, and had the book printed there.
Sir George Lewis followed and seized the edition at the printers on
the day of publication, when vans for its distribution were at their
door. The two thousand copies were carried off by the <i>Procureur
du Roi</i>. The matter came before the Belgian Courts in October 1891,
M. Edmond Picard and <i>Maître</i> Maeterlinck, cousin of Maeterlinck
the poet, appearing for Whistler. M. Harry, of the <i>Indépendance
Belge</i>, described Whistler in the witness-box, with the eyes of a Mephistopheles
flashing and sparkling under the thick eyebrows, his manner
easy and gay, his French fluent and perfect. He was asked his religion
and hesitated. The Judge, thinking to help him, suggested, "A
Protestant, perhaps?" His answer was a little shrug, as much as to
say, "I am quite willing. You should know. As you choose!" He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
was asked his age&mdash;even the Belgian reporter respected his objection
to having any. Judgment was given for him. Sheridan Ford was
sentenced to a fine of five hundred francs or three months' imprisonment;
to three thousand francs damages or three months more; to
the confiscation of the two thousand copies, and to costs. After the
trial Whistler was taken to the cellars of the Palais de Justice, and shown
the confiscated copies, stored there with other fraudulent goods, by
the law of Belgium destined to perish in dampness and gloom.</p>

<p>The affair has not been forgotten in Belgium&mdash;nor has Whistler.
One impression has been written for us by M. Edmond Picard, the
distinguished Senator, his advocate:</p>

<p>"<i>En me demandant de parler de l'illustre et regretté Whistler, vous
ne désirez certes pas que j'ajoute mon lot à la riche pyramide d'admiration
et d'éloges définitivement érigée à sa gloire.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Il ne peut s'agir, dans votre pensée que de ce que je pourrais ajouter
de spécial et de pittoresque à la Biographie du Grand Artiste.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Si j'ai beaucoup vu et aimé ses &oelig;uvres, je n'ai qu'entrevu son
originale personne.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Voici deux traits intéressants qui s'y rapportent.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Il y a quelques années il s'inquiéta d'une contrefaçon qu'un étranger
habitant Anvers avait perpétré en Belgique de son curieux livre, 'L'Art
charmant de se faire des ennemis.' Je le vis un jour entrer dans mon
cabinet et il me dit avec un sourire sarcastique, 'Je souhaiterais que
vous fussiez mon avocat dans cette petite affaire parcequ'on m'a dit que
vous pratiquez aussi bien que moi l'art charmant de se faire des
ennemis.'</i></p>

<p>"<i>Le procès fut gagné à Anvers avec la collaboration de mon confrère,
M. Maeterlinck, parent du poète qui honore tant notre pays. On célébra
chez lui cette victoire. Quand Whistler, héros de la fête, arriva dans
l'hospitalière maison, il s'attardait dans l'antichambre. La bonne qui
l'avait reçu vint, avec quelque effarement, dire en flamand au salon où
l'on attendait, 'Madame, c'est un acteur; il se coiffe devant le miroir, il se
pommade, il se met du fard et de la poudre!' Après un assez long intervalle,
Whistler parut, courtois, correct, ciré, cosmétiqué, pimpant comme
le papillon que rappêle son nom et qu'il mit en signature sur quelques-uns
des billets qu'il écrivit alors à ses conseils.</i></p>

<p>The "Extraordinary Piratical Plot," as Whistler called it in <i>The
Gentle Art</i>, did not end in Antwerp. Sheridan Ford took the book
to Paris, where it was issued by Delabrosse et Cie, 1890, though it is
said by Mr. Don C. Seitz to have been printed in Ghent; in Antwerp,
Mr. Ford recently told an interviewer&mdash;this edition we have seen;
while other copies, with the imprint of Frederick Stokes and Brother,
were sent to the United States. Sir George Lewis suppressed the
Paris edition and prevented the importation of the book into England,
and Messrs. Stokes cabled to London that their name was used without
their permission. The balance of the edition is stated to have been
destroyed by fire. Copies through the post reached England, sent
to newspapers for review and to individuals supposed to be interested,
among whom we were included. In June 1890 a so-called "second
edition" from Paris was received by some papers. Mr. Seitz says that
hardly any copies are in existence. Sheridan Ford says that nine
thousand were sold. But that was the last heard of it, and Sheridan
Ford's book was killed.</p>

<p>Judging from the facts, Whistler treated Ford badly, but Sheridan
Ford acted in defiance of Whistler, and in the Paris edition published an
article so vile that papers refused to print it. Three versions are given
as to the cause of the quarrel. The first is that Mrs. Whistler interfered
and told Whistler to take the work over himself; the second
is Sheridan Ford's statement that Whistler wished M. Duret to prepare
the book; and the third is the suggestion of Mr. Seitz that the difference
arose over the insertion of a letter of Oscar Wilde's. As this letter
was printed in Whistler's edition, Mr. Seitz's conclusions are of little
value and his assertions differ from Sheridan Ford's contemporary
tale. Whistler's version, published by Sheridan Ford in the letter
dated August 18, 1889, is: "I think, for many reasons, we would do
well to postpone the immediate consideration of the proposed publication
for a while. At this moment I find myself curiously interested
in certain paintings, the production of which might appropriately</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>
<p>be made anterior to mere literature." We have heard that he was
urged to come to this decision by Mr. Theodore Roussel, who told
him he ought to prepare the book, pay Sheridan Ford, and get rid of
him. Whistler obtained possession of Sheridan Ford's work, or rather
of his letters collected by Sheridan Ford, arranged them, commented
on them, and published them in his own fashion. Sheridan Ford's
book is undistinguished; Whistler's contains on every page evidence
of his care in carrying out his ideas of book decoration.</p>

<p>Whistler, who was delighted with Mr. William Heinemann's
artistic instinct, sympathy, enthusiasm, and quick appreciation of his
intention, gave him the book to publish. From the day their agreement
was signed the publisher entered into the matter with all his
heart. Whistler's fights were his fights, Whistler's victories his
victories. Whistler was flattered by his understanding of things and
came daily almost to take out his "publisher, philosopher, and friend,"
as he described Mr. Heinemann, to breakfast at the Savoy. He would
arrive at eleven, when the business man had hardly got into the swing
of his morning's work. Was it not preposterous that there should
be other books to be prepared, other matters to be thought of, while
this great work of art was being born? The Savoy balcony overlooking
the Embankment was, at so early an hour, deserted, and there they
could discuss, change, and arrange every detail without interruption.
Hours were spent often over a single Butterfly, and usually
Whistler's pockets were full of gay and fantastic entomological
drawings.</p>

<p>Whistler was constantly at the Ballantyne Press, where the book
was printed. He chose the type, he spaced the text, he placed the
Butterflies, each of which he designed to convey a meaning. They
danced, laughed, mocked, stung, defied, triumphed, drooped wings
over the farthing damages, spread them to fly across the Channel,
and expressed every word and every thought. He designed the title-page;
a design contrary to established rules, but with the charm,
the balance, the harmony, the touch of personality he gave to everything,
and since copied and prostituted by foolish imitators who had
no conception of its purpose. Mr. MacCall, of the Ballantyne Press,
has told us of his interest and has a proof of it in a collection of
Butterflies and proof sheets covered with Whistler's corrections. Here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
too, as everywhere by those he worked with, he is remembered with
affection, and the printers were delighted to profit by his suggestions.
The cover was in brown, with a yellow back. The title, though attributed
to Sheridan Ford, can be traced to Whistler's speech at the
Criterion dinner and the gentle answer that turneth not away wrath.
The dedication is: "To the rare Few, who, early in Life, have rid
Themselves of the Friendship of the Many, these pathetic Papers
are inscribed."</p>

<p>The book was published in June 1890 and has gone through eight
editions, Messrs. John M. Lowell and Co., and then Messrs. Putnam's
Sons, issuing it in America. It met the fate of all his works. The Press
received it with the usual smile at Mr. Whistler's eccentricities, and
here and there a word of praise and appreciation said with more
courage than of old. To the multitude of readers it was a jest;
to a saving remnant it was serious, to none more serious than to
Whistler, who knew it would live with the writings of Cellini, Dürer
and Reynolds.</p>

<p><i>The Gentle Art</i> is an artistic autobiography. Whistler gave the
sub-title <i>Auto-Biographical</i> to one section&mdash;he might have given it to
the whole. He had a way, half-laughing, half-serious, of calling it
his Bible. "Well, you know, you have only to look and there it all
is in the Bible," or "I am afraid you do not know the Bible as you
should," he often said to us in answer to some question about his
work or his life. The trial, the pamphlets, <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, the
<i>Propositions</i>, the letters, the catalogues take their place and appear
in their proper sequence, not as disconnected, inconsequent little
squibs and the elaborate bids for notoriety they were supposed
to be. The book, which may be read for its wit, is really his
Manifesto.</p>

<p>He included also the criticisms and comments that had provoked
him into print, for his object was to expose the stupidity and ridicule
he was obliged to face, so that his method of defence should be understood.
To read the book is to wonder the more that there should
have been necessity for defence, so simple and right is his theory, so
sincere and reverent his attitude. We have spoken of most of the
different subjects in it as they appeared. The collection intensifies
the effect each made individually. Everything he wrote had the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
end: to show that "art should be independent of all clap-trap;
should stand alone, and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without
confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion,
pity, love, patriotism, and the like. All these have no kind of concern
with it, and that is why I insist on calling my works 'arrangements'
and 'harmonies.'"</p>

<p>It was for the "knowledge of a lifetime" his work was to be
valued, he told the Attorney-General in court. In this paragraph,
and in this answer, you have the key to <i>The Gentle Art</i>. Fault may be
found with arguments; facts and methods may be challenged. But
analysis, description, technical statement, and explanation are so
many proofs of his belief in the independence of art and of his
surrender to that untiring devotion which the "goddess" demands of
her disciples.</p>

<p>It would seem impossible that his statement of simple truths should
have been suspected, were it not remembered that art in England
depended mostly on "clap-trap" when Whistler wrote, and that
his manner of meeting suspicion was intended to mystify. He took
care that his book should be the expression not only of his belief but
of his conception of art. Stupidity in critics and public hurt him as
much as insincerity in artists, and when confronted with it he was
pitiless. Dullness, too, he could not stand. He met it with "joyousness":
to be "joyous" was his philosophy of life and art, "where
all is fair," and this philosophy to the multitude was an enigma. His
letters to the Press are apt to be dismissed as shrill, cheap, thin, not
worthy a great artist, still unworthier of his endeavour to immortalise
them. It is true that he might have omitted some things from <i>The
Gentle Art</i>, though the names and ridicule he found for the "Enemies"
will stick to them for ever. But Whistler thought "history" would
be half made if he did not leave on record both the provocation he
received and his gaiety of retaliation. When the battle was won and
recognition came he wrote to Atlas from Paris: "We 'collect' no
more." <i>Messieurs les Ennemis</i> had no longer to fear for their "scalps."
Oftener than not the wit is cruel in its sting. We have quoted the
"F F F ... Fool" letter. There are others more bitter, because
gayer on the surface, to Tom Taylor, for instance that final disposing
of him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, my dear old Tom, I never <i>was</i> serious with you
even when you were among us. Indeed, I killed you quite, as who
should say without seriousness, 'A rat! A rat!' you know, rather
cursorily."</p>

<p>Whistler had the power of expressing himself in words which is
rare with artists. He could write, he had style. Literature, no less
than art, was to him a "dainty goddess." He worked out his shortest
letter as carefully as a portrait or a Nocturne, until all trace of labour
in it had disappeared. People, awed by the spectacle of Ruskin
wallowing amid the many volumes of <i>Modern Painters</i> without succeeding
in the end in saying what he wanted, could not believe that
Whistler was saying anything that mattered when he said in a few
pages what he wanted with no sign of labour. In his notes to <i>Truth</i>
and the <i>World</i>, as in <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>, he reveals his knowledge of the
Scriptures, while his use of French which displeased his critics, his odd
references, his unexpected quotations, are placed with the same unerring
instinct as the Butterfly on his canvas. He chose the right word,
he made the division of paragraphs effective, punctuation was with him
an art. It is difficult to give examples, because there are so many.
<i>The Ten O'Clock</i> is full of passages that show him at his best, none
finer than the often-quoted description of London "when the evening
mist clothes the riverside with poetry, as with a veil." The <i>Propositions</i>
and <i>The Red Rag</i> are as complete, as simple and direct as his
prints. The book, as an exposition of his beliefs and doctrines, ranks
with Reynolds' <i>Lectures</i>; as a chronicle of an artist's adventures, it
is as personal and characteristic as the <i>Memoirs of Cellini</i>. We have
been criticised for devoting so much space to Whistler's wit and his
writings, but as a wit and writer Whistler will live. He was a many-sided
man, not a lop-sided painter.</p>

<p>The period of the preparation and publication of <i>The Gentle Art</i>
was one of unimportant quarrels. In each case there was provocation.
Of two or three so much was made at the time that they cannot be
ignored. One, in 1888, was with Mr. Menpes, who, making no secret
of it, has recorded its various stages until the last, when the Follower
adopted the Master's decorations and arrangements in his own house.
His <i>Home of Taste</i> was paragraphed in the papers, and Whistler held
him up to the world's ridicule as "the Kangaroo of his country, born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
with a pocket and putting everything into it." The affair came to
a crisis not long after the <i>Times</i> Parnell disclosures, and Whistler wrote
to him: "You will blow your brains out, of course. Pigott has shown
you what to do under the circumstances, and you know your way to
Spain. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Once afterwards, at a public dinner, Whistler saw Mr. Menpes
come into the room on Mr. Justin McCarthy's arm: "Ha ha!
McCarthy," he laughed as they passed him. "Ha ha! You should
be careful. You know, Damien died."</p>

<p>In 1890 Augustus Moore, brother of George, was added to the list
of "Enemies." The cause was an offensive reference to Godwin,
Mrs. Whistler's first husband, in <i>The Hawk</i>, an insignificant sheet
Moore edited. Whistler, knowing that he would find him at any
first-night, went to Drury Lane for the autumn production, <i>A Million
of Money</i>, and in the foyer hit Moore with a cane across the face, crying,
"Hawk! Hawk!" There was a scrimmage, and Whistler, as the man
who attacked, was requested to leave the house. The whole thing
was the outcome of a sense of honour, a feeling of chivalry, which
is not now understood in England, though it would have been found
magnificent in the days of duels. The comic papers made great fun
of the episode, and the serious ones lamented the want of dignity it
showed. No one understood Whistler's loyalty and his devotion to
the woman he had married.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV: THE TURN OF THE TIDE.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-ONE AND EIGHTEEN NINETY-TWO.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> world owed him a living, Whistler said, but it was not until 1891
that the world began to pay the debt with the purchase of the <i>Carlyle</i>
for Glasgow and the <i>Mother</i> for the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>While the <i>Carlyle</i> was at the Glasgow Institute in 1888, Mr. E. A.
Walton and Sir James Guthrie made up their minds to try to keep
it for the city. Since the attempt to secure it for Edinburgh, the
Glasgow School had become a power, and as they proclaimed themselves
followers of Whistler, it was only right they should do everything
to retain the picture in Glasgow. A petition was presented to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Glasgow Corporation, signed by a long list of names of influential
people, which greatly pleased Whistler, for they included Gilbert,
Orchardson, Millais, Walton, Guthrie, and many others. The price
asked by Whistler was a thousand guineas, and a deputation
from the Corporation came to call on him in London. Whistler
told us:</p>

<p>"I received them, well, you know, charmingly, of course. And
one who spoke for the rest asked me if I did not think I was putting
a large price on the picture&mdash;one thousand guineas. And I said,
'Yes, perhaps, if you will have it so!' And he said that it seemed
to the Council excessive; why, the figure was not even life-size.' And
I agreed. 'But, you know,' I said, 'few men are life-size.' And
that was all. It was an official occasion, and I respected it. Then
they asked me to think over the matter until the next day, and they
would come again. And they came. And they said, 'Have you
thought of the thousand guineas and what we said about it, Mr.
Whistler?' And I said, 'Why, gentlemen, why&mdash;well, you know,
how could I think of anything but the pleasure of seeing you again?'
And, naturally, being gentlemen, they understood, and they gave me
a cheque for the thousand guineas."</p>

<p>What Whistler meant by "life-size" he has explained. "No
man alive is life-size except the recruit who is being measured as he
enters the regiment, and then the only man who sees him life-size is
the sergeant who measures him, and all that he sees of him is the end
of his nose; when he is able to see his toes, the man ceases to be life-size."</p>

<p>Before the <i>Carlyle</i> went to Glasgow Whistler wished to show
it in London, where, except in Queen Square, it had not been seen
since the Grosvenor Exhibition of 1877, and it was exhibited at the
Goupil Gallery. Mr. D. Croal Thomson, then director of the Gallery,
saw that the tide was turning, and suggested offering the <i>Mother</i> to
the Luxembourg. In Paris there was a sluggish sort of curiosity and
the beginning of a sort of appreciation. During the last ten years
Whistler had shown at the <i>Salon</i> his <i>Lady Meux</i>, the <i>Mother</i>, <i>Carlyle</i>,
<i>Miss Alexander</i>, <i>The Yellow Buskin</i>, <i>M. Duret</i>, <i>Sarasate</i>, and in 1891
his Ros<i>a Corder</i> was in the new <i>Salon</i>; but save for the third-class
medal awarded the <i>Mother</i> in 1883 his pictures received no official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
recognition, and while several scarcely known Americans were made
full members of the <i>Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts</i> he was at first
simply an Associate. Many of his smaller works had been seen at
different times in the Petit Gallery. At Mr. Croal Thomson's suggestion
the <i>Mother</i> was sent to Messrs. Boussod Valadon in Paris, and
subscriptions for the purchase were opened. Before any amount
worth mentioning was subscribed the French Government, on the
initiative of M. Georges Clémenceau and by the advice of M. Roger
Marx, bought it for the nation. M. Bourgeois, the Minister of Fine
Arts, had some doubt as to the possibility of offering for so fine a
masterpiece the small price that the nation could afford. But Whistler
set him at ease on this point, writing to him that it was for the <i>Mother</i>,
of all his pictures, he would prefer so "solemn a consecration," and
that he was proud of the honour France had shown him. The price
paid was four thousand francs. Whistler told Mr. Cole, November 14,
1891, that his pleasure was in the fact of "his painting of his mother
being 'unprecedentedly' chosen by the Minister of Beaux-Arts for the
Luxembourg," and France that same year bestowed upon him an
honour he valued higher than almost any he ever received, by making
him Officer of the Legion of Honour. But the choice was not unprecedented,
pictures of other American artists having already been purchased,
while the honour had already been bestowed upon American
artists now forgotten.</p>

<p>The event was celebrated by a reception at the Chelsea Arts Club
on the evening of December 19, 1891. Whistler was presented with
a parchment of greetings signed by a hundred members as "a record
of their high appreciation of the distinguished honour that has come
to him by the placing of his mother's portrait in the national collection
of France."</p>

<p>Whistler said in reply that he was gratified by this token from his
brother artists: "It is right at such a time of peace, after the struggle,
to bury the hatchet&mdash;in the side of the enemy&mdash;and leave it there.
The congratulations usher in the beginning of my career, for an artist's
career always begins to-morrow."</p>

<p>He promised to remain for long one of the Chelsea artists, a promise
Chelsea artists showed no desire to keep him to. He was a member
of the Club until he went to Paris. When, later, Mr. (now Sir John)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301                                                                                              ]</a></span>
Lavery proposed him as an Honorary Member, there was not enough enthusiasm
to carry the motion. And when, still later, it was further
proposed that the Chelsea Arts Club should officially recognise the
Whistler Memorial they refused, and the comment of one man was,
"What had an English Club to do with a memorial by a Frenchman to a
Yankee in London?"</p>

<p>Early in 1892 Mr. Croal Thomson arranged with Whistler for
an exhibition of <i>Nocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces</i> to be held
at the Goupil Gallery in London, or, as Whistler called it, his "heroic
kick in Bond Street." Mr. Croal Thomson says his first idea was
to show the portraits only. But he soon found that Whistler wanted
to include all the paintings and was going to take the matter in hand,
and that he was "only like the fly on the wheel" once the machinery
was set in motion.</p>

<p>One reason of the success of the exhibition, which surprised not
only Mr. Croal Thomson but all London, was Whistler's care when
selecting his pictures to secure variety. The collection was a magnificent
refutation of everything that the critics had been saying about him
for years. They dismissed his pictures as sketches, and he confronted
them with <i>The Blue Waves</i>, <i>Brown and Silver&mdash;Old Battersea Bridge</i>,
<i>The Music Room</i>, which had not been seen in London since the early
sixties. They objected to his want of finish and slovenliness in detail,
and his answer was the Japanese pictures, full of an elaboration the
Pre-Raphaelites never equalled, and finished with an exquisiteness of
surface they never attempted. He was told he could not draw, and he
produced a group of his finest portraits. He was assured he had no
poetic feeling, no imagination, and he displayed the Nocturnes, with
the factories and chimneys transformed into a fairyland in the night.
He was as careful in arranging the manner in which the pictures should
be presented. His letters to Mr. Croal Thomson from Paris, where
he spent the greater part of 1892, were minute in his directions for
cleaning and varnishing the paintings, and putting them into new
frames of his design. Indeed, the correspondence on the subject,
which we have seen, is a miracle of thoughtfulness, energy, and method.</p>

<p>Mr. Croal Thomson tells us: "Mr. Whistler laboured almost
night and day: he wrote letters to every one of the owners of his works
in oil asking loans of the pictures. Some, like Mr. Alexander and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the Ionides connection, acceded at once, but others made delays, and
even to the end several owners declined to lend. On the whole, however,
the artist was well supported by his early patrons, and the result
was a gathering together of the most complete collection of Mr.
Whistler's best works&mdash;forty-three pictures in all.</p>

<p>"The arrangement of the pictures was entirely Mr. Whistler's,
for although he wished several young artists to come to the Gallery
the evening the works were to be hung, through some mischance
they did not arrive, and I was therefore alone with Mr. Whistler and
received a great lesson in the art of arranging a collection."</p>

<p>In the face of so complete a series, in such perfect condition, and
so well hung, criticism was silenced. We remember the Press view,
and the dismay of the older critics who hoped for another "crop of
little jokes," and the triumph of the younger critics who knew that
Whistler had won. The papers, daily, weekly, and monthly, almost
unanimously admitted that the old game of ridicule was played out
and praised the exhibition without reserve. The rest, headed by
Sir Frederick Wedmore, have since been trying to swallow themselves.
Mr. Croal Thomson recalls that:</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler was not present at the private view. He knew that
many people would expect to see him and talk enthusiastic nonsense,
and he rightly decided he was better away, and I was left to receive
the visitors. Some hundreds of cards of invitation were issued, and
it seemed as if every recipient had accepted. Crowds thronged the
galleries all day, and it is impossible to describe the excitement. I do
not know how it fared with the artist and his wife during the day,
but about five o'clock in the evening Mr. and Mrs. Whistler came in,
though they would not enter the exhibition; they remained in a
curtained-off portion of the Gallery near the entrance. One or two
of their most intimate friends were informed by me of the presence of
the painter, and a small reception was held, for a little while, but,
of course, by that time the battle was won, and there were only congratulations
to be rendered to the master."</p>

<p>J. was taken into the little curtained-off room, and later there
was a triumphal procession to the Arts Club. Whistler declared that
even Academicians had been seen prowling about the place lost in
admiration, that it needed only to send a season ticket to Ruskin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
make the situation perfect, and that, "Well, you know, they were
always pearls I cast before them, and the people were always&mdash;well,
the same people."</p>

<p>It is said Whistler first intended to print the catalogue without
comment or quotation from the Press, but the chance to expose the
critics was too good, and previous critical verdicts were placed under
the titles of the pictures. Two hundred and fifty copies were printed
by Thomas Way, and in a letter to Way's manager, Mr. Morgan,
he calls the catalogue "perfect." But he also points out that there
are errors, and insists that by no accident or disaster shall any of the
first printed batch of two hundred and fifty copies get about, and he
further says that he proposes to come to the printing office and destroy
them. We know of only four copies, one our own&mdash;now in the Library
of Congress&mdash;of this unbound first edition that have been preserved.
The other editions, five in all, are in the usual brown paper covers.
As an instance of his care, Mr. William Marchant, then with Goupils',
remembers his spending an afternoon over the arrangement of the few
words on the cover. In the second edition the word "by" disappeared
from the title-page and "Kindly Lent Their Owners" was printed.
This was not intentional on Whistler's part, for we possess a letter
in which he asks that it may be put back at once, and also that the
"Moral" at the end of the catalogue, "Modern <i>British</i> (!) art will now
be represented in the National Gallery of the Luxembourg by one of
the finest paintings due to the brush of an <i>English artist</i> (!)," should be
credited not to him, but to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. Before the
edition was exhausted the "Kindly Lent Their Owners" had become
famous, though it did not appear in subsequent editions. But it reappeared
when the catalogue was reprinted in <i>The Gentle Art</i>. The
extracts he quoted were cruel, but the critics had been cruel. The
sub-title, "<i>The Voice of a People</i>" explains his object in publishing
them. The catalogue ended with the quotation from the <i>Chronique
des Beaux-Arts</i>:</p>

<p>"<i>Au musée du Luxembourg, vient d'être placé de M. Whistler,
le splendide Portrait de Mme. Whistler mère, une &oelig;uvre destinée à
l'éternité des admirations, une &oelig;uvre sur laquelle la consécration des
siècles semble avoir mis la patine d'un Rembrandt, d'un Titien, où d'un
Vélasquez.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>This, in later editions, was followed by the "Moral" duly credited
to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.</p>

<p>Before the show closed the pictures were photographed, and twenty-four
were afterwards published in a portfolio called <i>Nocturnes, Marines,
and Chevalet Pieces</i>, by Messrs. Goupil. Whistler designed the cover
in brown. There were a hundred sets, each photograph signed by
him, published at six guineas, and two hundred unsigned at four
guineas.</p>

<p>An immediate result of the exhibition was that sitters came. One
of the first was the Duke of Marlborough, who gave him a commission
for a portrait and asked him and Mrs. Whistler to Blenheim for
the autumn. Whistler wrote the Duke one of his "charming letters,"
then heard of his sudden death, and said:</p>

<p>"Now I shall never know whether my letter killed him, or whether
he died before he got it. Well, they all want to be painted because
of these pictures, but why wouldn't they be painted years ago
when I wanted to paint them, and could have painted them just as
well?"</p>

<p>And he was besieged by Americans, Whistler said, who were determined
"to pour California into his lap," a determination to which
he had no objection. His "pockets should always be full, or my
golden eggs are addled." He thought it would be "amazing fun"
to be rich. Once, driving with Mr. Starr, he said:</p>

<p>"Starr, I have not dined, as you know, so you need not think I
say this in any but a cold and careful spirit: it is better to live on bread
and cheese and paint beautiful things than to live like Dives and paint
pot-boilers. But a painter really should not have to worry about
'various,' you know. Poverty may induce industry, but it does not
produce the fine flower of painting. The test is not poverty, it's
money. Give a painter money and see what he'll do; if he does not
paint his work is well lost to the world. If I had had, say, three thousand
pounds a year, what beautiful things I could have done."</p>

<p>No one could know better than Mr. Croal Thomson how complete
was this success:</p>

<p>"I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the exhibition
marked a revolution in the public feeling towards Whistler. His
artistic powers were hitherto disputed on every hand, but when it
was possible for lovers of art to see for themselves what the painter had
accomplished the whole position was changed. I will be pardoned,
I hope, in stating that whereas up to that time the pictures of Mr.
Whistler commanded only a small sum of money, after the exhibition
a great number of connoisseurs desired to acquire his works, and therefore
their money value immediately increased.</p>

<p>"In the Goupil collection all the pictures were contributed by
private owners, and none were offered for sale. I may say in passing
that, as a matter of fact, the crowds of visitors were so great that no
transaction of any serious kind was carried through in the Gallery
between the hanging of the pictures and their dispersal&mdash;that is, for
nearly five weeks there was practically no record of business.</p>

<p>"But the exhibition altered all this, and it is revealing no secrets
to say that within a year after the exhibition was closed I had aided
in the transfer of more than one-half of the pictures from their first
owners. Mr. Whistler, to whom I always referred before concluding
any transaction, came to the conclusion that there was hardly a holder
of his pictures in England but who would sell when tempted by a large
price. It may be that these owners had become affected by the continual
misunderstanding and abuse of Mr. Whistler's works, and that
when they were offered double or three times the sum for which they
had their pictures insured they thought they had better take advantage
of the enthusiasm of the moment. They did not realise that this
enthusiasm would continue to enlarge, and that what seemed to them
as original purchasers of the pictures to be a great price is only about
one-fourth of their present money value.</p>

<p>"It was the artist's wish that a similar exhibition should be held
in Paris, but the project fell through, and from more recent experience
it would appear as if the London public, sometimes so severely scoffed
at by Mr. Whistler, was really more appreciative than the Parisian
public, and, therefore, perhaps after all more intelligent."</p>

<p>Whistler sold <i>The Falling Rocket</i> for eight hundred guineas, and
wished that Ruskin could know that it had been valued at "four pots
of paint." The Leyland sale, May 28, 1892, brought the <i>Princesse
du Pays de la Porcelaine</i> and smaller works into the auction-room,
and, though the <i>Princesse</i> fetched only four hundred and twenty
guineas, this was four times as much as Whistler received. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
would he have said to the five thousand Mr. Freer paid for it within
a year of his death? The sixty or eighty pounds Mr. Leathart paid
Whistler for the <i>Lange Leizen</i> increased to six or eight hundred when
he sold it. Mr. Ionides had bought <i>Sea and Rain</i> for twenty or thirty
pounds, and now asked three hundred. Fifty pounds, the price of
the <i>Blue Wave</i> when Mr. Gerald Potter had it from Whistler, multiplied
to a thousand when it was his turn to dispose of it. Fourteen
hundred pounds was given by Arthur Studd for <i>The Little White Girl</i>
and a Nocturne, the two having cost Mr. Potter about one hundred
and eighty pounds, and we have been told that Arthur Studd was recently
offered six thousand pounds for <i>The Little White Girl</i> alone.
Whistler resented it when he found that fortunes were being made "at
his expense" by so-called friends, and he complained that they were
turning his reputation into pounds, shillings, and pence, travelling
over Europe and holiday-making on the profits. The previous sentence
was written when our book first appeared. During 1918 and 1919, there
has been a fabulous increase in the selling price of Whistler's work. We
do not know what amount was paid by Mr. Frick for the <i>Lady Meux</i>,
the <i>Rosa Corder</i>, and the <i>Mrs. Leyland</i> which he recently purchased.
Some of the reports of prices are greatly exaggerated, no doubt. A few
owners of Whistlers do appreciate them. But nearly all collectors in
the United States regard art as they do stocks. They buy for a rise,
and appreciate only the monetary value of the works they possess.
One of the most striking cases is that of Mr. Howard Mansfield,
whom Whistler, during many years, furnished with some of his most
interesting prints, aided and directed in their collection, hoping, of
course, that they would be left to a museum. But Mr. Mansfield
sold his collection for an enormous price, altogether out of proportion
to what Whistler received. Surprising statements have been
circulated about the sale of pictures. The announcement of the price
recently paid for the <i>Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine</i> is as incorrect
as the title given to the painting, which is simply a small slight sketch
and different version of the important subject owned by Mr. Freer.
The bigger the lie, the more impressive is such a statement concerning
the prices asked and obtained&mdash;the merit of the work is
of secondary importance. This is a fair specimen of American
commercial art criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Whistler, after the trade in his work began, suggested that a work
of art, when sold, should still remain the artist's property; that it
was only "lent its owner." It was now his frequent demand to
owners and condition to purchasers that his pictures should be available
for exhibition when and where and as often as he pleased. This is
illustrated in the following letter which Mr. H. S. Theobald, K.C.,
writes us:</p>

<p>"... About 1870 I began to get such of his etchings as I could,
and somewhere early in the eighties I became the fortunate possessor
of some thirty or forty drawings and pastels through the Dowdeswells.
Whistler became aware of my ownership of these, and they sometimes
brought him to my house, which was then in Westbourne Square.
The pictures, owing to stress of space, hung mostly on the staircase,
and Whistler would stand in rapt admiration before them, with occasional
ejaculations of 'how lovely,' 'how divine,' and so on. On one
of these occasions he asked my wife if she had had her portrait taken.
'But of course not,' he added, 'as I have not painted you.'</p>

<p>"My intercourse with the Master was limited to occasions when
he wanted to borrow the pictures. His manner of proceeding was
somewhat abrupt. Some morning a person would appear in a four-wheel
cab and present Whistler's card, on which was written, 'Please
let bearer have fourteen of my pictures.' Sometimes, but not often,
there was a preliminary warning from Whistler himself. But though
the pictures went easily, it was a labour of Hercules to retrieve them.
Once when I went to fetch them at his studio by appointment, after
a previous effort, also by appointment, which was not kept, I found
the studio locked, but after a search among the neighbours I got the
key, and then I found some two or three hundred pictures stacked
round the room buried in the dust of ages. Whistler loved his pictures
but he certainly took no care of them. On that occasion I remember
I took away by mistake in exchange for one of my pictures, a Nocturne
that did not belong to me, though it was very like one of mine. You
can imagine the Master's winged words when he found this out. I
could only cry <i>mea culpa</i> and bow my head before the storm. It was
the risk to which I feared the pictures were exposed which made me
harden my heart."</p>

<p>Whistler was as anxious to keep his pictures out of exhibitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
when for some reason he did not care to have them shown. The large
<i>Three Girls</i> (<i>Three Figures, Pink and Grey</i>, in the London Memorial
Exhibition) was at Messrs. Dowdeswell's in the summer of 1891. He
had before this tried to get possession of it in order that he might destroy
it, and he had offered to paint the portrait of the owner and his wife
in exchange. His offer was refused, and while the picture was at
Messrs. Dowdeswell's, he wrote a letter to the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>
(July 28, 1891), to explain that it was a painting "thrown aside for
destruction." An impudent answer from a critic led to a more explicit
statement of his views on the subject:</p>

<p>"All along have I carefully destroyed plates, torn up proofs and
burned canvases that the truth of the quoted word shall prevail, and
that the future collector shall be spared the mortification of cataloguing
his pet mistakes. To destroy, is to remain."</p>

<p>When this picture, with a number of studies for it, was sent to
the London Memorial Exhibition, it was found very interesting and
it was hung, and we think it fortunate that it was not destroyed.
But had the Committee known it was the picture he wished destroyed
it never would have been exhibited by the International Society.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1892, Whistler was invited by the Duke of Argyll
to contribute to the British Section at the World's Columbian Exposition
to be held in Chicago the following year, and the picture mentioned
for the purpose was the <i>Carlyle</i>. The portrait had been skied in a
corner the previous winter at the Victorian Exhibition in the New
Gallery, of which Mr. J. W. Beck was Secretary, as he was now of the
Fine Arts Committee for Chicago. Whistler wrote to Mr. Beck, sending
his "distinguished consideration to the Duke and the President"
(Leighton) with the assurance "that I have an undefined sense of
something ominously flattering occurring, but that no previous desire
on his part ever to deal with work of mine has prepared me with the
proper form of acknowledgment. No, no, Mr. Beck! Once hung,
twice shy!"</p>

<p>When the letter was sent to the papers and printers made "sky"
of the "shy" Whistler was enchanted. Mr. Smalley told the story of
the invitation in the <i>Times</i>, after Whistler's death, under the impression
that he had been invited to show at Burlington House. That
Whistler never was invited to show anything there we know, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
have the further testimony of Sir Fred Eaton, Secretary of the Academy,
that "No such proposal as Mr. Smalley speaks of was ever made to
Mr. Whistler, and it is difficult to understand on what grounds he
made such a statement."</p>

<p>It is an amusing coincidence that this would seem to be confirmed
by the fate of a letter addressed to Whistler, "The Academy,
England," which, after having gone to the newspaper of that name,
was next sent to Burlington House, and, finally, reached Whistler
with "Not known at the R.A.," written on the cover. Here was one
of the little incidents that Whistler called "the droll things of this
pleasant life," and he sent the cover for reproduction to the <i>Daily
Mail</i> with the reflection:</p>

<p>"In these days of doubtful frequentation it is my rare good fortune
to be able to send you an unsolicited official and final certificate of
character."</p>

<p>Whistler did not depend upon the British Section at the Chicago
Exposition. Americans made up for the official blunders of 1889.
Professor Halsey C. Ives, chief of the Art Department, wrote letters
that Whistler found most courteous, and everything was done to
secure his pictures and prints. He was splendidly represented by
The <i>Yellow Buskin</i>, the <i>Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine</i>, <i>The Fur
Jacket</i>, among paintings, and by etchings of every period. The
medal given him was the first official honour from his native land,
where never before had so representative a collection of his work been
seen.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1892 the appreciation of America was expressed
in another form. The new Boston Library was being built, and Messrs.
McKim, Meade, and White were the architects. It was determined
that the interior should be decorated by the most distinguished American
artists. Mr. Sargent and Mr. Abbey were commissioned to do part
of the work, and they joined with Mr. McKim and St. Gaudens in trying
to induce Whistler to undertake the large panel at the top of the stairs.
He made notes and suggestions for the design, which, he told us, was
to be a great peacock ten feet high; but the work was put off, and, in
the end, nothing came of the first opportunity given him for mural
decoration since The Peacock Room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI: PARIS.<br />THE YEARS EIGHTEEN NINETY-TWO
AND EIGHTEEN NINETY-THREE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> went to live in Paris again in 1892. Moving from
London was a complicated affair, and, during several months, he and
Mrs. Whistler and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Whibley, were continually
running backward and forward, before they settled in the Rue du Bac.
We saw him whenever he came to London and whenever we were in
Paris, and, as we were there often, we saw much of him.</p>

<p>A group of artists and art critics, whose appreciation of Whistler
had not waited for the turning of the tide, were in the habit of going
together to Paris for the opening of the <i>Salon</i>. In 1892, R. A. M.
Stevenson, Aubrey Beardsley, Henry Harland, D. S. McColl, Charles
W. Furse, Alexander and Robert Ross, among others, were with us,
and to all it was a pleasure to find Whistler triumphing as he had
triumphed earlier in the spring in London. His pictures at the Champ-de-Mars
were the most talked about and the most distinguished in an
unusually good <i>Salon</i>. Many came straight from the Goupil Exhibition.
Whistler called it "a stupendous success all along the line," and
said that, coming after the Goupil "heroic kick," it made everything
complete and perfect. He was pleased also with the fact that he was
elected a full <i>Sociétaire</i>, and this year a member of the jury.</p>

<p>In the autumn, J., returning to Paris after a long summer in the
South of France, found Whistler in the Hôtel du Bon Lafontaine, a
house, Whistler said, full of bishops, cardinals, and <i>monsignori</i>, and
altogether most correct, to which he had moved from the Foyot,
inhabited by Senators, after a bomb had exploded in the kitchen
window. J. says:</p>

<p>"He was not too comfortably established, in one or two small
rooms. He was full of the apartment in the Rue de Bac, which I
was taken to see, though there was nothing to see but workmen and
packing-boxes. In the midst of the moving, he was working, and one
day I found him in his bedroom with Mallarmé, whose portrait in
lithography he was drawing, and there was scarcely room for three.
This portrait is the frontispiece to Mallarmé's <i>Vers et Prose</i>.</p>

<p>"It was the first time I had ever seen Whistler working on a lithograph.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
He had great trouble with this portrait, which he did more than
once, not altogether because, as M. Duret says, he could not get the
head right, but because he was trying experiments with paper. He
was thoroughly dissatisfied with the mechanical grained paper which
he had used for the <i>Albermarle</i> and the <i>Whirlwind</i> prints, and he was
then afraid of trusting to the post the paper that Way was sending him.
He had found at Belfont's or Lemercier's some thin textureless transfer
paper, thin as tissue paper, which delighted him, though it was difficult
to work on. When he was doing the Mallarmé, he put the paper down
on a roughish book cover. He liked the grain the cover gave him, for
it was not mechanical, and, when the grain seemed to repeat itself,
he would shift the drawing, and thus get a new surface. I do not know
whether he used this thin paper to any extent, but he said he found
it delightful, if difficult, to work on. He used that afternoon a tiny
bit of lithographic chalk, holding it in his fingers, and not in a crayon-holder
as lithographers do.</p>

<p>"The next day, he took me to the printers, Belfont's and Lemercier's,
where he introduced me to M. Duchâtel and M. Marty, who was
preparing <i>L'Estampe Originale</i>, devoting himself to the revival of
artistic lithography in France. As I remember, the talk was technical,
when not of the wonders of the apartment in the Rue du Bac&mdash;where
'Peace threatens to take up her abode in the garden of our pretty
pavilion,' Mr. Starr quotes Whistler as saying&mdash;and the studio in
the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, which I did not see until later
on. He was also planning his colour lithographs, and he explained
to me his methods, though very few colour-prints were made until
the next year. He also told me what he thought of printing etchings
in colour&mdash;that it was abominable, vulgar, and stupid. Good black
or brown ink, on good old paper, had been good enough for Rembrandt,
it was good enough for him, and it ought to be good enough in the
future for the few people who care about etching. To-day, when
the world is swamped with the childish print in colour and the
preposterous big copper plate, it may be well to remember Whistler's
words. His reason for rejecting the etching in colour is as simple
and rational as his reason for making the lithograph in colour. Lithography
is a method of surface printing; the colour, rolled on to the
surface of the stone, is merely rubbed on to, and scraped off on, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
paper. In etching or engraving, the colour is first hammered into
the engraved plate with a dabber and then forced out by excessive
pressure, fatal to any but the strongest or purest of blacks and browns;
and colours, whether printed from one plate or a dozen, must have
the freshness, the quality, squeezed out of them."</p>

<p>He was back in London at the end of December (1892) eating his
Christmas dinner with his future brother-in-law. He stayed only a
few days, but long enough to arrange to show <i>Lady Meux: White and
Black</i> in the first exhibition of the Portrait Painters at the Grafton
Gallery, early in 1893, and a number of his Venice etchings with the
destroyed plates at the Fine Art Society's.</p>

<p>"We were again in Paris for the <i>Salon</i> of 1893, and found Whistler
living in the Rue du Bac. Beardsley, MacColl, and 'Bob' Stevenson
were with us. MacColl and I went to see Whistler in the new studio.
It was at the top of one of the highest buildings in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs,
No. 86. As the <i>concierge</i> said, in directing visitors,
'<i>On ne peut pas aller plus loin que M. Vistlaire!</i>' The climb always
seemed to me endless, and must have done much harm to Whistler's
weak heart, though benches were placed on some of the landings
where, if he had time, he could rest. When we got to the sixth storey
MacColl knocked. There was a rapid movement across the floor,
and the door was opened a little. Whistler held his palette and
brushes between himself and us, and there were excuses of models
and work. But MacColl felt the brushes, and they were dry, and
so we got in.</p>

<p>"The studio was a big, bare room, the biggest studio Whistler ever
had. A simple tone of rose on the walls, a lounge, a few chairs, a whitewood
cabinet for the little drawings and prints and pastels; the blue
screen with the river, Chelsea church, and the gold moon; two or three
easels, nothing on them; rows and rows of canvases on the floor with
their faces to the wall; in the further corner a printing press&mdash;rather
a printing shop&mdash;with inks and papers on shelves; a little gallery above,
a room or two opening off; a model's dressing-room under it, and in
front, when you turned, the great studio window, with all Paris toward
the Pantheon over the Luxembourg gardens. There was another
little room or entrance-hall at the top of the stairs, and opposite another,
a kitchen. On the front was a balcony with flowers.</p>

<p>"Carmen, his model, was there, and while he showed us some of
his work she got breakfast, and we stayed a good part of the day. Mrs.
Whistler came up later. I think she breakfasted with us. I have no
recollection of what he talked about. But I am sure it was of what
they had been saying in London, of what they were saying in Paris,
of what he was doing. That is what it always was. We were all asked
to lunch the following Sunday at the house.</p>

<p>"The apartment, No. 110 Rue du Bac, was on the right-hand side,
just before you reached the <i>Bon Marché</i>, going up the street, from the
river. You went through a big <i>porte cochère</i> by the <i>concierge's</i> box,
down a long, covered tunnel, then between high walls, until you came to
a courtyard with several doors, a bit of an old frieze in one place and
a drinking-fountain. Whistler's door was painted blue, with a brass
knocker. I do not suppose that then there was another like it in Paris.
Inside was a little landing with three or four steps down to the floor a
few feet lower than the courtyard. This room contained nothing, or
almost nothing, but some trunks (which, as in his other houses, gave the
appearance of his having just moved in, or being just about to start
on a journey) and a settee, always covered with a profusion of hats and
coats. Opposite the entrance a big door opened into a spacious room,
decorated in simple, flat tones of blue, with white doors and windows,
furnished with a few Empire chairs and a couch, a grand piano, and a
table which, like the blue matting-covered floor, was littered with newspapers.
Once in a while there was a picture of his on the wall. For
some time, the <i>Venus</i> hung or stood about. There were doors to the
right and left, and on the far side, a glass door opened on a large
garden, a real bit of country in Paris. It stretched away in dense
undergrowth to several huge trees. Later, over the door, there
was a trellis designed by Mrs. Whistler, and there were flowers everywhere.
'In his roses he buried his troubles,' Mr. Wuerpel writes of
the garden, and there were many birds, among them, at one time, an
awful mocking-bird, at another a white parrot which finally escaped,
and, in a temper, climbed up a tree where no one could get it, and
starved itself to death to Whistler's grief. At the bottom of the garden
were seats. The dining-room was to the right of the drawing-room.
It was equally simple in blue, only there was blue and white china
in a cupboard and a big dining-table, round which were more Empire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
chairs and in the centre a large, low blue and white porcelain stand,
on it big bowls of flowers, over it, hanging from the ceiling, a huge
Japanese something like a birdcage.</p>

<p>"From Paris, in May, I went down to Caen and Coutances, coming
back a few weeks later. Beardsley was still in Paris, or had returned,
and we were both stopping at the Hôtel de Portugal et de l'Univers, then
known to every art student. Wagner was being played at the Opera,
almost for the first time. Paris was disturbed, there were demonstrations
against Wagner, really against Germany. We went, Beardsley
wild about Wagner and doing, I think, the drawing of <i>The Wagnerites</i>.
He had come over to get backgrounds in the rose arbours and the dense
alleys of the Luxembourg gardens, where Whistler had made his
lithographs. Coming away from the Opera, we went across to the
Café de la Paix at midnight. The first person we saw was Whistler.
He was with some people, but they left soon, and we joined him.
Beardsley also left almost at once, but not before Whistler had asked
us to come the next Sunday afternoon to the Rue du Bac. Then,
for the first time, I learned what he thought of 'æstheticism' and
decadence.'</p>

<p>"'Why do you get mixed up with such things? Look at him!
He's just like his drawings, he's all hairs and peacock's plumes&mdash;hairs
on his head, hairs on his fingers' ends, hairs in his ears, hairs on his toes.
And what shoes he wears&mdash;hairs growing out of them!'</p>

<p>"I said, 'Why did you ask him to the Rue du Bac?' 'Oh&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;well!'
And then it was late, or early, and the last thing was,
'Well, you'll come and bring him too.'</p>

<p>"Years later, in Buckingham Street, Whistler met Beardsley, and
got to like not only him, as everybody did, but his work. One night
when Whistler was with us, Beardsley turned up, as always when he
went to see anyone, with his portfolio of his latest work under his arm.
This time it held the illustrations for <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, which he had
just made. Whistler, who always saw everything that was being done,
had seen the <i>Yellow Book</i>, started in 1894, and he disliked it as much
as he then disliked Beardsley, who was the art editor; he had also
seen the illustrations to <i>Salomé</i>, disliking them too, probably because
of Oscar Wilde; he knew many of the other drawings, one of which,
whether intentionally or unintentionally, was more or less a reminiscence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of Mrs. Whistler, and he no doubt knew that Beardsley had made a
caricature of him which a Follower carefully left in a cab. When
Beardsley opened the portfolio and began to show us <i>The Rape of the
Lock</i>, Whistler looked at them first indifferently, then with interest,
then with delight. And then he said slowly, 'Aubrey, I have made a
very great mistake&mdash;you are a very great artist.' And the boy burst
out crying. All Whistler could say, when he could say anything, was
'I mean it&mdash;I mean it&mdash;I mean it!'</p>

<p>"On the following Sunday Beardsley and I went to the Rue du Bac,
Beardsley in a little straw hat like Whistler's. Whistler was in the
garden and there were many Americans, and Arsène Alexandre and
Mallarmé, some people from the British Embassy, and presently Mr.
Jacomb Hood came, bringing an Honourable Amateur, who asked the
Whistlers, Beardsley, and myself to dinner at one of the <i>cafés</i> in the
Champs-Elysees. As we left the Rue du Bac, Whistler whispered to me,
'Those hairs&mdash;hairs everywhere!' I said to him, 'But you were very
nice and, of course, you'll come to dinner.' And, of course, he did not.</p>

<p>"I was working in Paris, making drawings and etchings of Notre-Dame.
I was in one of the high old houses of lodgings and studios,
with cabmen's <i>cafés</i> and restaurants under them, on the Quai des Grands
Augustins. I had gone there because of the view of the Cathedral.
Most of the time I was at work up among the Devils of Notre-Dame,
using one of the towers as a studio by permission of the Government
and the Cardinal-Archbishop. One morning&mdash;it was in June&mdash;I
heard the puffing and groaning of someone climbing slowly the endless
winding staircase, and the next thing I saw was Whistler's head
on the stairs. When he got his breath and I had got over my astonishment,
I began to ask why he had come, or he began to explain the
reason. He had learned where I was staying, and he said he had been
to the hotel, which, was, well! I think it reminded him of his days <i>au
sixième</i>, for that was the floor I was on. He left a note written on the
<i>buvette</i> paper, in which he said, 'Jolly the place seems to be!' After he
had climbed up to my rooms, the <i>patron</i> told him where he possibly
would find me, and then the people at the foot of the tower said I was up
above.</p>

<p>"He told me why he had come up. He was working on a series of
etchings of Paris. Some were just begun, others ready to bite, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
number ought to be printed, and would I help him? I was pleased,
and I said I would. I took him about among the strange creatures
that haunt the place, introduced him to the old keeper with his grisly
tales of suicides and of sticking to the tower through the Commune,
even when the church was on fire, and showed him the awful bell that,
at noon, suddenly crashed in our ears, the uncanny cat that perched
on crockets and gargoyles, tried to catch sparrows with nothing below
her, and made from one parapet to another flying cuts over space when
visitors came up. But he did not like it, and was not happy until
we were seated in the back room of a restaurant across the street.
He talked about the printing, saying that I could help him, and he could
teach me.</p>

<p>"Next morning I was at the Rue du Bac at nine. After I had
waited for what seemed hours, and had breakfasted with him and Mrs.
Whistler and we had a cigarette in the garden, where there was an
American rocking-chair for him&mdash;well, after this it was too late to go
to the studio. He brought out some of the plates which he had been
working on&mdash;the plates of little shops in the near streets&mdash;and we looked
at them, and that was all. So it went on the next day, and the next,
until on the third or fourth things came to a head, and I told him that
charming as this life was, either we must print or I must go back to my
drawing. In five minutes we were in a cab on our way to the studio.
He understood that, much as I admired his work and appreciated him,
I could not afford to pay for this appreciation and admiration with
my time. From the moment this was plain between us, there was no
interruption to our friendship for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>"We set to work. He peeled down to his undershirt with short
sleeves, and I saw in his muscles one reason why he was never tired.
He put on an apron. The plates, only slightly heated, if heated at all,
were inked and wiped, sometimes with his hand, at others with a rag,
till nearly clean, though a good tone was left. He painted the proofs
on the plate with his hand. I got the paper ready on the press and
pulled the proof, he inking and I pulling all the afternoon. As each
proof came off the press, he looked at it, not satisfied, for they were all
weak, and saying 'we'll keep it as the first proof and it will be worth
something some day.' Then he put the prints between sheets of
blotting-paper, and that night or the next, after dinner, trimmed them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
with scissors and put them back between the folded sheets of blotting-paper
which were thrown on the table and on the floor. Between the
sheets the proofs dried naturally and were not squashed flat.</p>

<p>"The printing went on for several days, he getting more and more
dissatisfied, until I found an old man, Lamour, at the top of an old
house in the Rue de la Harpe, who could reground the plates. But
Whistler did not rebite them and never touched them until long after
in England.</p>

<p>"A number of plates had not been bitten and one hot Sunday
afternoon he brought them into the garden at the Rue du Bac. A chair
was placed under the trees and on it a wash-basin into which each plate
was put. Instead of pouring the diluted acid all over the plate in the
usual fashion drops were taken from the bottle on a feather, and the
plate painted with acid. The acid was coaxed, or rather used as one
would use water-colour, dragged and washed about. Depth and
strength were got by leaving a drop of acid on the lines where they were
needed. There was a little stopping-out of passages where greater
delicacy was required; when there was any, the stopping-out varnish
was thinned with turpentine, and Whistler, with a camel's-hair brush,
painted over the parts that did not need further biting. To me, it
was a revelation. Sometimes he drew on the plate. Instead of the
huge crowbar used by most etchers he worked with a perfectly balanced,
beautifully designed little needle three or four inches long, made for
him by an instrument-maker in Paris. He always carried several in a
little silver box. The ground on all the plates was bad and came off,
and the proofs he pulled afterwards in the studio were not at all what
he wanted. These were almost the last plates he etched.</p>

<p>"He was not painting very much, few people came to the studio,
and he went out little. No one was in the Rue du Bac but Mrs. Whistler
for a while, and there were complications with the servants and others&mdash;how
people who kept such hours, or no hours, could keep servants
would have been a mystery had not servants worshipped him. Almost
daily the <i>petit bleu</i> asking me to dinner would come to me. Or Whistler
would appear in the morning, if I had not been to him the day before.
In those early June days I seldom met anyone at the house and we never
dressed for dinner, possibly because I had no dress clothes with me; he
would insist on my coming, telling me not to mind the stains or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
inkspots! One evening in the garden with them I found a little man,
a thorough Englishman in big spectacles, with a curious sniff, who was
holding a hose and watering the plants. He was introduced to me as
Mr. Webb, Whistler's solicitor, though in the process we came near
being drenched by the wobbling hose. It was that evening I first heard
the chant of the missionary brothers from over the great wall. A
bell sounded, and as the notes died away a wailing chant arose, went
on for a little, then died away as mysteriously as it came. Always,
when it did come, it hushed us. At dinner we should be cosy and
jolly, Whistler had said in asking me, and we were, and it was arranged
that we should go the next day to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>"They called for me at the hotel in the morning. We drove to
the Lyons station, Whistler, his wife, Mr. Webb, and I. And Whistler
had the little paint-box which always went with him, though on these
occasions it was the rarest thing that he ever did anything, and we got
to Fountainebleau. We lunched in a garden. We didn't go to the
palace, but drove to Barbizon, stopping at Siron's, through the forest.
I don't think the views or the trees interested him at all. He was
quiet all the way, but no sooner were we back than we must hunt for
'old things': 'here was a palace and great people had lived here, there
might be silver, there might be blue and white, though really, now,
you know, you can find better blue and white, and cheaper silver, under
the noses of the Britons in Wardour Street than anywhere.' We did
not find any blue and white, or silver. But there were three folio
volumes of old paper, containing a collection of dried leaves, which we
bought and shared, and they were to him more valuable than the palace
and the Millet studio, which we never saw.</p>

<p>"It was late when we got back. The servants had gone to bed,
and Marguery's and the places where he liked to dine were shut. So
we bought what we could in the near shops and sat down in the Rue du
Bac to eat the supper we had collected. After we had finished I
witnessed his and Mrs. Whistler's wills, which Mr. Webb had brought
with him from London, and for this the long day had been a preparation.</p>

<p>"If I did not always accept Whistler's invitations he would reproach
me as an awful disappointment and a bad man. If I did not go to the
dinner, to which I was bidden at an hour's notice, he would tell me
afterwards of the much cool drink and encouraging refreshment he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
had prepared for me. He always asked me to bring my friends. Mr.
J. Fulleylove had come over to 'do' Paris and I took him to the Rue du
Bac; '<i>les Pleins d'Amour</i>,' Whistler called him and Mrs. Fulleylove,
whose eyes he was always praising. They were working at St. Denis
and so was I, and one day Whistler and Mrs. Whistler came in the
primitive steam tram that starts from the Madeleine to see the place.
We lunched&mdash;badly&mdash;and he was bored with the church, though he
had brought lithograph paper and colours to make a sketch of it.</p>

<p>"One Sunday Mr. E. G. Kennedy posed in the garden for his
portrait on a small canvas or panel, and all the world was kept out. I
had never before seen Whistler paint. He worked away all afternoon,
hissing to himself, which, Mrs. Whistler said, he did only when things
were going well. If Kennedy shifted&mdash;there were no rests&mdash;Whistler
would scream, and he worked on and on, and the sun went down, and
Kennedy stood and Whistler painted, and the monks began their chant,
and darkness was coming on. The hissing stopped, a paint-rag came
out, and, with one fierce dash, it was all rubbed off. 'Oh, well,' was all
he said. Kennedy was limbered up and we went to dinner.</p>

<p>"After that, almost every night we dined together through that
lovely June, either with him in the Rue du Bac, or he came with
Kennedy or me to Marguery's or La Pérouse&mdash;once to St. Germain&mdash;or
somewhere that was delightful.</p>

<p>"The summer was famous in Paris for the 'Sarah Brown Students'
Revolution,' the row that grew out of the <i>Quat'z Arts</i> Ball. Whistler
did not take the slightest interest in the demonstrations, in fact, did
not believe they were taking place, though I used to bring him reports
of the doings which culminated on July 4, my birthday, when he was
to have given me a dinner at Marguery's. I told him the streets of the
Quarter were barricaded and full of soldiers, but though he ridiculed
the whole affair, he decided to dine at home and to put off by telegram
the dinner he had ordered. I went round to the Boulevard St. Germain
to send the wire and found it barred with soldiers and police, and the
entire boulevard, as far as one could see, littered with hats and caps,
sticks and umbrellas. There had been a cavalry charge and this was
the result. We dined merrily, but Kennedy and I left early. There
was a great deal of rioting through the night, but that was the end
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Whistler had not been well, and they suddenly made up their
minds to go to Brittany, or Normandy, or somewhere on the coast.
It was not altogether a successful journey. Nature had gone back
on him, he wrote me, probably because of his exposure of her 'foolish
sunsets'; the weather was for tourists, the sea for goldfish in a bowl&mdash;the
studio was better than staring at a sea of tin. And the terrible
things they had eaten in Brittany made them ill. But the lithographs
at Vitré were made, also the <i>Yellow House, Lannion</i>, and the <i>Red
House, Paimpol</i>&mdash;his first elaborate essays in colour.</p>

<p>"Only a few impressions of the <i>Yellow House</i> were ever pulled
owing to some accident to the stone. One of these I wanted to
buy. Whistler heard of it 'Well, you know, very flattering, but
altogether absurd,' he told me, and the print came with an inscription
and the Butterfly."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII: PARIS CONTINUED.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-THREE AND EIGHTEEN NINETY-FOUR.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this summer, we both saw still more of Whistler whenever we
were in Paris. At the Rue du Bac we were struck by the few French
artists at his Sunday afternoons and the predominance of Americans
and English. It seemed to us that French artists might have been more
cordial and the French nation more sensible of the fact that a distinguished
foreign artist had come to France. During his life at least one
or two Americans, one a rich amateur, were made Commanders of the
Legion of Honour, while he remained an Officer. Others were made
foreign Members of the Academy of Fine Arts, but this, the highest
honour for artists in France, was never offered to him, nor was he elected
to International Juries.</p>

<p>With a few French and foreign artists his relations were friendly:
Boldini, Helleu, Puvis de Chavannes, Rodin, Alfred Stevens, Aman-Jean;
but the greater number were content to express their appreciation
at a distance. Mrs. Whistler spoke little French, and few French
artists speak any English. The men whom Whistler saw most were not
painters. Viélé-Griffin, Octave Mirbeau, Arsène Alexandre, the Comte
de Montesquiou, Rodenbach came to the Rue du Bac. Old friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Drouet and Duret, were sometimes there, though not often&mdash;his intimacy
with them and Oulevey was not really renewed until after Mrs.
Whistler's death. But of all who came, none endeared himself so much
to Whistler as Stéphane Mallarmé, poet, critic, friend, admirer. Once,
at Whistler's suggestion, he visited us in London, and, looking from our
windows to the Thames, declared he could understand Whistler better.
Official people strayed in from the Embassies, mostly English. American
authors and American collectors appeared on Sundays. Mr.
Howells, once or twice, came with his son and his daughter, of whom
Whistler made a lithograph. Journalists, English and American,
wandered in. And English and American artists came, or tried to come,
in crowds. The younger men of the Glasgow School, James Guthrie
and John Lavery, were welcomed. Then there were the Americans
living in Paris: Walter Gay, Alexander Harrison, Frederick MacMonnies,
Edmund H. Wuerpel, John W. Alexander, Humphreys
Johnston, while Sargent and Abbey rarely missed an opportunity of
calling at the Rue du Bac.</p>

<p>Whistler was hardly less cordial to students. Milcendeau has told
us how he took his work&mdash;and his courage&mdash;with him and went to
Whistler, but, reaching the door, stood trembling at the thought of
meeting the Master and showing his drawings. As soon as Whistler
saw the drawings his manner was so charming&mdash;as if they were just two
artists together&mdash;that fear was forgotten, and Whistler proved his
interest by inviting Milcendeau to send the drawings to the International.
Whistler met American and English students not only at
home, but at the American Art Association in Montparnasse, then a bit
of old Paris&mdash;a little white house with green shutters, which the street
had long since left on a lower level, and at the back a garden where,
under the great trees, the cloth was laid in summer; just the house to
please Whistler. He sometimes went to the club's dinners and celebrations.
At one dinner on Washington's Birthday, after professional professors
and popular politicians had delivered themselves, he was finally
and rather patronisingly asked to speak by the President, who was either
an ambassador or a dry-goods storekeeper, the usual patron of American
art and supporter of American art institutions. Whistler said: "Now,
as to teaching. In England it is all a matter of taste, but in France
at least they tell you which end of the brush to stick in your mouth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. MacMonnies remembers another evening: "A millionaire
friend of Whistler's and mine spoke to me of giving a dinner to the
American artists in Paris, or rather to Whistler, and inviting the
Paris American artists. I dissuaded him, by saying they all hated
one another and would pass the evening more cheerfully by sticking
forks into one another under the table if they could. Better to invite
all the young fry&mdash;the American students. He gladly went into
it. You can imagine the wild joy of the small fry, who had, of
course, never met Whistler. Some got foolishly drunk, others got
bloated with freshness, but they all had a rare time, and Whistler, who
sat at the head, more than any, and he was delightfully funny. The
millionaire was enchanted, and also a distinguished American painter,
who sat opposite to Whistler and who was much respected by the youth.
At one pause Whistler said, 'I went to the Louvre this morning'&mdash;pause,
all the youths' faces wide open, expecting pearls of wisdom and
points&mdash;'and I was amazed'&mdash;pause; everybody open-eared&mdash;'to
see the amazing way they keep the floors waxed!'"</p>

<p>There is a story that one day at lunch-time he went into the courtyard
of the <i>Ecole des Beaux-Arts</i> and walked slowly round, only to be
followed in a few minutes by a single line of students, each carrying a
mahlstick as he carried his cane, and as many as had them wearing two
<i>sous</i> pieces for eye-glasses. He stopped and looked at the statues he
wanted to see and they stopped and looked, and they followed him,
until the circuit of the court was made, when they bowed each other out,
and it was not till long after that they learned who he was. American
students, if not so filled with their own sense of humour, are said to
have mobbed him on one occasion when he went to a <i>crémerie</i>, upsetting
tables and chairs to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Gay, who was much with Whistler during these years,
gives us his impressions:</p>

<p>"I first knew Whistler in the winter of '94, when he was established
in Paris, with the recently married Mrs. Whistler, in his apartment of
the Rue du Bac. The marriage was a happy one; she appreciated
fully his talent, he adored her, and when she died a few years later was
crushed at her loss. In spite of the great influence exercised by Whistler
on contemporary art, he was never lionised in Paris as he had been in
London; Paris is not a place for lions, there are already too many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
local celebrities. Perhaps one of the reasons why the French artists
held aloof from Whistler was Mrs. Whistler's very British attitude
towards the nation. Once at a dinner of French artists given at our
house in honour of Whistler, Mrs. Whistler expressed the most Gallophobe
sentiments, complaining loudly of the inhospitality of the French
towards her husband. Although sixty years when I knew him, he had
the enthusiasm and energy of early years. His handsome grey-blue
eyes sparkled with the fire of youth&mdash;they were young eyes in an old
face. I think it strange that no one ever seems to emphasise his singular
beauty. Not only were his features finely cut, but the symmetry of his
figure, hands, and feet, retained until late in life, was remarkable; in
youth he must have been a pocket Apollo. His conversational powers
were extraordinary&mdash;he had a Celtic richness of vocabulary.... He
was supersensitive to criticism. Those who were either indifferent
or antipathetic to him, his imagination instantly transformed into
hidden enemies. That weakness of the artistic temperament, <i>la folie
de la persécution</i>, was deeply rooted in his nature....</p>

<p>"No one can realise, who has not watched Whistler paint, the agony
his work gave him. I have seen him after a day's struggle with a
picture, when things did not go, completely collapse as from an illness.
His drawing cost him infinite trouble. I have known him work two
weeks on a hand, and then give it up discouraged.... My last
interview with Whistler took place in the spring of 1903, in London,
about two months before his death. Hearing that he was far from well,
I went to see him, and found that the rumour was only too well grounded.
I spent the afternoon with him; he was singularly gentle and affectionate,
and clung to me pathetically as though he too realised that
it was to be our last meeting in this world.</p>

<p>"Whatever his detractors may charge against him, it seems to me
that Whistler's faults and weaknesses sprang from an unbalanced
mentality; he was a <i>déséquilibré</i>, the common defect of great painters.
The unusual combination of artistic genius, literary gifts, and social
attractions which made up Whistler's personality was unique; there
was never anybody like him. And there is another quality of his which
must not be forgotten in the summing up of his character; underneath
all his vagaries and eccentricities one felt that indefinable yet unmistakable
being&mdash;a gentleman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Alexander Harrison shows a different side of Whistler:
"My meetings with him were frequent and friendly. On one
occasion, in a moment of excitement, I had the audacity to tell him that
I felt he ought to have acted differently <i>vis-à-vis</i> a jury of reception.
His eyes flamed like a rattlesnake's and I apologised, but insisted, and
then dodged a <i>little</i>. I afterwards realised that my naïve frankness
had not lowered me in his esteem, as to the last he was nice to me, having
understood that my admiration for his work was no greater than my
affectionate regard for him. I have never known a man of more sincere
and genuine impulse in ordinary human relations."</p>

<p>Now that Whistler was established for life, as he hoped, in a fine
studio, he was making up for the first unsettled years after his marriage.
He began a number of large portraits in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs.
In 1893, Mr. A. J. Eddy, known, we believe, to fame and
Chicago as "the man Whistler painted," asked Whistler to paint his
portrait. He could stay in Paris only a few weeks, and Whistler liked
his American frankness in saying that his portrait must be done by a
certain date, and, though unaccustomed to be tied to time, Whistler
agreed. His description of Mr. Eddy was, "Well, you know, he is
the only man who ever did get a picture out of me on time, while I
worked and he waited!" Mr. Eddy writes of a sitter, no doubt himself,
who was with Whistler "every day for nearly six weeks and never
heard him utter an impatient word; on the contrary, he was all kindness."
And Mr. Eddy describes Whistler painting on in the twilight
until it was impossible to distinguish between the living man and the
figure on the canvas. He recalls the memory of those "glorious"
days spent in the studio, of the pleasant hour at noon when painter and
sitter breakfasted there together, of the long sittings, and the dinner
after at the Rue du Bac, or in one of the little restaurants where no
Parisian was more at home than Whistler. But steadily as the work
went on, the picture was not sent to Chicago until the following year.
Mr. J. J. Cowan, whose portrait dates from this time, tells us that for
<i>The Grey Man</i>, a small full-length, he gave sixty sittings, averaging each
three to four hours. He, like Whistler, was not in a hurry, but, unlike
Whistler, he eventually got tired, and a model was called in and posed
in Mr. Cowan's clothes. The last sittings were in London, three years
after. Even then Whistler wrote Mr. Cowan that the head needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
just the one touch, with the sitter there, so that perfection might be
assured. Another portrait was of Dr. Davenport of Paris.</p>

<p>The portraits of women were more numerous, and they promised
to be as fine as those done in the seventies and eighties. The work was
interrupted by the tragedy of Whistler's last years, and the more
important were never completed. For one, Miss Charlotte Williams,
of Baltimore, sat, but the painting disappeared, and only the rare lithograph
of her remains. Another lost portrait was a large full-length of
Miss Peck, of Chicago, now Mrs. W. R. Farquhar, which we saw in
many stages, and at last, as it seemed to us, finished. She was painted
standing, in evening dress, with her long white, green-lined cloak thrown
back a little, as he had painted Lady Meux. It was full of the charm
of youth, and the colour was a harmony in silver and green. Miss
Kinsella, a third American girl who posed in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs,
and in Fitzroy Street, secured her portrait after Whistler's
death. We remember it in the Fitzroy Street studio, when it was so
perfect that one more day's work would ruin it. In no other did he
ever paint flesh with such perfection. Face and neck had the golden
tone of Titian, with a subtlety of modelling beyond the Venetian's
powers, for in his later years it was to surpass the Venetians he was trying.
One day when E. went to the studio he had just scraped down neck
and bust, for no reason except that he could not get the hand to come
right with the rest. It was to be lovelier than ever, he said. It was
never repainted. It remains but a shadow of its loveliness. When M.
Rodin saw it at the London Memorial Exhibition, he praised neck and
bust to J. as "a beautiful suggestion of lace," so beautiful in tone and
modelling it still is. That posing for Whistler was difficult we know
from these ladies and many of his other sitters, as well as from our experience.
Over and over, when he wanted to work on their portraits, he
would telegraph to the last address he happened to have, though sometimes
the telegrams did not reach them till weeks after in some distant
part of the world. The fact that his sitters were not always waiting for
him not only upset him temporarily, but sometimes stopped the subject
altogether. One incident in connection with the portrait of Miss Kinsella
amused him. She holds an iris in her hand. A real flower was got,
but the flower would fade, and irises were not easy to obtain. So he
went to Liberty's to get some stuff of the purple-violet tone he wanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
out of which to make a flower. He explained what he needed to the
shopman, who solemnly informed him that Messrs. Liberty only kept
"art colours."</p>

<p>Portraits of Mrs. Charles Whibley were in progress about the same
time: <i>L'Andalouse, Mother of Pearl and Silver</i>, the unfinished <i>Tulip,
Rose and Gold</i>, and <i>Red and Black, The Fan</i>. Two others of this period
are of Mrs. Walter Sickert, <i>Green and Violet</i>, the second for which she
sat, and Lady Eden, <i>Brown and Gold</i>. He was also painting his own
portrait in the white jacket, which was changed into a black coat after
Mrs. Whistler's death, and a full-length in a long brown overcoat shown
in 1900 and not since.</p>

<p>The large canvases had to be left when he shut up the studio, but
he could carry his little portfolio of lithographic paper and box of chalks
everywhere, and during those two or three years he developed the art of
lithography as no one had before, he and Fantin-Latour being the two
chief factors in the revival of lithography in the nineties. He was
determined, he said, to make "a roaring success of it." In the streets
and at home he was constantly at work, and the result is the series of
lithographs of the shops and gardens and galleries of Paris and many
portraits. His interest in technique was tireless. He experimented on
transfer-paper and on stone. He hunted old paper as strenuous people
hunt lions. Drawings and proofs were for ever in the post between
Paris and London, where the Ways were transferring and printing for
him, and friends were for ever bringing paper from London or carrying
drawings tremblingly back from Paris. He was deep in experiments
with colour, and a few of the lithographs for <i>Songs on Stone</i>, already
announced by Mr. Heinemann, were at last ready. They were proved
in Paris by Belfont, but his shop closed in 1894, printer and stones
vanished, and this was the end of the proposed publication. Since
Whistler's death mysterious prints in black-and-white from the key
stones have turned up in Germany, but only a few prints in colour
remain, no two alike, trials in colour. He had looked for great things:
"You know, I mean them to wipe up the place before I get done,"
he said, and their loss was a severe disappointment. Other lithographs,
made then or later, were published in the <i>Studio</i>, the <i>Art Journal</i>,
<i>L'Estampe Originale</i>, <i>L'Imagier</i>, the <i>Pagenat</i>, and one in our <i>Lithography
and Lithographers</i>. He never wanted to keep his work, no matter in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
what medium, from the public. With commissions and experiments
keeping him busy in Paris, Whistler was, as he wrote to us in London,
working from morning to night, and in a condition for it he wouldn't
change for anything. He was compelled to change it only too soon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII: TRIALS AND GRIEFS.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-FOUR TO EIGHTEEN NINETY-SIX.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1894 interruptions came, some slight, but one so serious that life
and work were never the same again.</p>

<p>A tedious annoyance was caused by Du Maurier's <i>Trilby</i> in <i>Harper's
Magazine</i>. Du Maurier represented the English students at Carrel's
(Gleyre's) as veritable Crichtons, while Whistler, under the name of
Joe Sibley, was ridiculed. Du Maurier's drawings left no doubt as
to the identity, for in one Whistler wears the <i>chapeau bizarre</i> over his
curls. Another shows him running away from a studio fight, and
the text is more offensive. Joe Sibley is "'the Idle Apprentice,'
the King of Bohemia, <i>le roi des truands</i>, to whom everything was
forgiven, as to François Villon, <i>à cause de ses gentillesses</i>.... Always
in debt ... vain, witty, and a most exquisite and original artist
... with an unimpeachable moral tone.... Also eccentric in his
attire ... the most irresistible friend in the world as long as his
friendship lasted, but that was not for ever.... His enmity would
take the simple and straightforward form of trying to punch his
ex-friend's head; and when the ex-friend was too big he would get
some new friend to help him.... His bark was worse than his bite
... he was better with his tongue than his fists.... But when he
met another joker he would just collapse like a pricked bladder. He
is now perched on such a topping pinnacle (of fame and notoriety
combined) that people can stare at him from two hemispheres at
once."</p>

<p>Du Maurier had posed as a friend for years, and in the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i> Whistler protested against the insult. Du Maurier, to an
interviewer, expressed surprise; he thought the description of Joe
Sibley would recall the good times in Paris, and he pretended to be
amazed that Whistler did not agree. He claimed that he was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Whistler's victims, and quoted Sheridan Ford's pirated edition of
<i>The Gentle Art</i>:</p>

<p>"It was rather droll. Listen: 'Mr. Du Maurier and Mr. Wilde
happening to meet in the rooms where Mr. Whistler was holding his
first exhibition of Venice etchings, the latter brought the two face to
face, and, taking each by the arm, inquired, "I say, which one of you
two invented the other, eh?"' The obvious retort to that, on my part,
would have been that, if he did not take care, I would invent <i>him</i>,
but he had slipped away before either of us could get a word out....
I did what I did in a playful spirit of retaliation for this little jibe about
me in his book."</p>

<p>The editor of <i>Harper's</i> had not understood the offensive nature
of the passages. Whistler called his attention to them, and an apology
was published in the magazine (January 1895), the number was suppressed,
and Du Maurier was compelled to omit them, and to change
Joe Sibley to Bald Anthony in the book. Whistler, when the changes
were submitted to him, was satisfied. But he said:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, what would have happened to the new Thackeray
if I hadn't been willing? But I was gracious, and I gave my approval
to the sudden appearance in the story of an Anthony, tall and stout
and slightly bald. The dangerous resemblance was gone. And I
wired&mdash;well, you know, ha ha!&mdash;I wired to them over in America
compliments and complete approval of author's new and obscure
friend, Bald Anthony!"</p>

<p><i>Trilby</i> was burlesqued at the Gaiety, and Whistler was dragged
in as <i>The Stranger</i>. His hat, overcoat, eye-glass, curls, and cane were
copied, but no one paid the slightest attention, and <i>The Stranger</i>
vanished after the first night.</p>

<p>Sometimes Whistler found insult where none was intended, as
in the case of a <i>Bibliography</i> compiled in 1895 for the <i>Library Bulletin</i>
of the University of the State of New York&mdash;all the copies burnt, we
hear, in the fire at the State Capitol, Albany. It was an appreciation,
but it contained inaccuracies and quoted as authorities critics he objected
to, and he was more vexed by it than there was need. Another
annoyance was an anonymous article in <i>McClure's Magazine</i>; <i>Whistler,
Painter and Comedian</i> (September 1896). He demanded an apology
and the suppression of the article, and both were granted. And so
it went on to the end; he was continually coming upon references
to himself, disfigured by misunderstanding, misrepresentation, and
malice.</p>

<p>These worries occupied his time and tried his temper. But he was
overwhelmed late in 1894 by a trouble infinitely more tragic. His
wife was taken ill with the terrible disease, cancer. They came to
London to consult the doctors in December. First they stayed at
Long's Hotel in Bond Street, Mrs. Whistler surrounded by her numerous
sisters, the two Paris servants, Louise and Constant, in attendance;
then Mrs. Whistler was under a doctor's care in Holles Street, and
Whistler stopped with his brother in Wimpole Street. Those who
loved him would like to forget his misery during the weeks and months
that followed. Work was going on somehow; not painting, that
waited in Paris, but lithography&mdash;several portraits of Lady Haden,
a drawing in Wellington Street, and others. But he told Mr. Way
afterwards that he wanted them all destroyed; he should not have
worked when his heart was not in it: "It was madness on my part."
He brought proofs to show us. Almost every afternoon he would
take J. to Way's, where the lithographs were being transferred to the
stone and printed. He would lunch or dine with us, keeping up his
brave front, though we knew what was in his heart. He had not been
in his "Palatial Residence" two years before it was closed, and the
canvases were left untouched in the "Stupendous Studio." New
honours and new successes came: in 1894 the Temple Gold Medal
from the Pennsylvania Academy, in 1895 a Gold Medal from Antwerp,
and innumerable commissions. It was just as fortune smiled that the
blow fell.</p>

<p>The Eden trial, which struck many as an unnecessary and almost
farcical episode in his life, distracted him during these tragic months.
His work ceased for weeks at a time, and he devoted himself to the
case. His journeys to Paris were frequent and his correspondence
enormous. The case was fought out in the courts of France. It
arose out of the uncertainty as to the price which Sir William Eden
should pay for his wife's portrait. He was introduced to Whistler
by Mr. George Moore, to whom Whistler had mentioned one hundred
to one hundred and fifty pounds for a sketch in water-colour or pastel.
Whistler became interested in his sitter and made a small full-length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
oil, for which he would have asked a far larger sum. His irritation
can be understood when Sir William Eden attempted to make him
accept as "a valentine"&mdash;for it was paid on February 14&mdash;one hundred
pounds in a sealed envelope. Whistler felt that the amount should have
been left to him to decide. He refused to give up the picture, he cashed
the cheque, and he did not return the money until legal proceedings
were taken by the Baronet. Before the case came into court he
wiped out the head. Even his friends thought that Whistler made
a grave mistake and prejudiced his case when he cashed the cheque,
instead of throwing it after the Baronet, who, on his hasty retreat
from the studio, Whistler said, protested and threatened all the way
down the six flights, while he from the top urged the Baronet not to
expose his nationality by so unseemly a noise in a public place.</p>

<p>Whistler went to Paris for the trial before the Civil Tribunal on
March 6, 1895. His advocates were Maître Ratier, by whose side he
sat in court, and Maître Beurdeley, a collector of his etchings. Sir
William Eden failed to appear. Whistler was ordered to deliver the
portrait as painted, a penalty to be imposed in case of delay; to refund
twenty-five hundred francs, his lowest price; to pay in addition one
thousand francs damages. The judge stated that he was in honour
bound not to deface the portrait after he had completed it, and that
an artist must carry out his contract.</p>

<p>To Whistler the judgment was unjust; he appealed in the Cour de
Cassation, and the matter dragged on until after Mrs. Whistler's death.
In England "An Artist" (J.) tried to raise a fund to pay the expenses
of the trial, in order "to show in some practical form artists' appreciation
for the genius of James McNeill Whistler." His appeal was
responded to by only one other artist, Mr. Frederick MacMonnies,
and was as unsuccessful as the subscription started after the Ruskin
trial in 1878.</p>

<p>Mr. George Moore had been the go-between when the portrait
was commissioned, Sir William Eden's ally in the legal business, and a
conspicuous figure in the newspaper muddle. After the trial Whistler
wrote Moore a scathing letter. Moore's answer was to taunt Whistler
with old age. This was published in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> and
reprinted in French papers. Whistler was in France and he sent
Moore a challenge. Whistler's seconds were M. Octave Mirbeau and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
M. Viélé-Griffin. Their challenge remained unanswered, but after
several days Moore relieved his feelings to a reporter. London looked
upon the challenge as Whistler's crowning joke. It was no joke to
Moore, who was sufficiently conversant with French manners to know
how his conduct would be received in Paris. Whistler's seconds sent
a <i>procès verbal</i> to the Press, stating that they had waited eight days for
an answer, and not having received one, they considered their mission
terminated.</p>

<p>Thus before the world Whistler kept up the game, though in the
Rue du Bac life was a tragedy. Mrs. Whistler had returned more ill
than ever. Miss Ethel Philip was married from the house early in
the summer to Mr. Charles Whibley, and her sister, Miss Rosalind
Birnie Philip, took her place.</p>

<p>After the trial Whistler went back to work. He sent <i>The Little
White Girl</i> to the International Exhibition at Venice; he exhibited
the second portrait of Mrs. Sickert at the Glasgow Institute; he chose
six lithographs for the Centenary Exhibition in Paris. A head of
Carmen, his model, was ready for the Portrait Painters in London.
When in the late summer he returned to England, and, with Mrs.
Whistler, settled at the Red Lion Hotel, Lyme Regis, he arranged
a show of his lithographs in London. The Society of Illustrators, of
which he was Vice-President, was preparing an anthology, <i>The London
Garland</i>, edited by W. E. Henley, illustrated by members, and published
by Messrs. Macmillan. J. asked him to contribute an illustration to
a sonnet of Henley's. But he had to abandon this plan and allow a
Nocturne to be reproduced. He made several lithographs at Lyme
Regis: glowing forges, dark stables with horses an animal painter
would envy, the smith, and the landlord. "Absolute failures, some,"
he told us sadly; "others, well, you know, not bad!" Two of the
pictures painted at Lyme Regis are masterpieces: <i>The Little Rose of
Lyme Regis</i> and <i>The Master Smith</i>. In these he solved the problem
of carrying on his work as he wished until it was finished. There also
he painted the only large landscape we know of: the white houses of
the town, the hill-side with trees beyond.</p>

<p>While he was still in Dorset a prize was awarded him at Venice.
Several prizes in money were given in different sections to artists of
different nationalities. Whistler was awarded two thousand five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
hundred francs by the City of Murano, the seventh on the list. He
knew the "enemies," foresaw the prattle there would be of the seventh-hand
compliment, and forestalled it by explaining in the Press how the
prizes had been awarded, his being equal to the first.</p>

<p>The exhibition of his lithographs was held at the Fine Art Society's
in December 1895. Seventy were shown, mostly of the work of the last
few years, and J. wrote an introduction to the catalogue, the only time
he asked anybody to "introduce" him. There were no decorations in
the gallery, nor was the catalogue in brown paper, save twenty-five
copies, but the prints were in his frames. English artists became
interested in lithography because they were asked to contribute to the
Centenary Exhibition in Paris, and, at the call of Leighton, they tried
their hands at it, more or less unsuccessfully. The contrast was great
between their work shown at Mr. Dunthorne's gallery and Whistler's,
whose prints alone are destined to live.</p>

<p>Whistler derived little pleasure from his triumph. The winter
was spent moving from place to place. His plans were made to go to
New York to consult an American specialist, forgetting as well as he
could "the vast far-offness" of America. But he stayed in London,
first at Garlant's Hotel, then in apartments in Half-Moon Street,
later at the De Vere Gardens Hotel, and then at the Savoy. Work of
one sort or another marked these moves: the lithograph of <i>Kensington
Gardens</i> from the De Vere Hotel; at the Savoy most pathetic drawings
of his wife, <i>The Siesta</i> and <i>By the Balcony</i>, and the Thames from the
hotel windows. He had during the first months no studio in London.
He worked for a while in Mr. Walter Sickert's; Mr. Sargent lent his
early in 1896, when there was talk of a lithograph of Cecil Rhodes and
a portrait of Mr. A. J. Pollitt, of whom he made a lithograph, though
the painting, begun later in Fitzroy Street, was destroyed.</p>

<p>He interested himself in the experiments of others. In the winter
of 1895 J. was asked by the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> to edit the illustration of
a series of articles on London in support of the Progressive County
Council. It was an event of importance to illustrators, process-men,
and printers: the first effort in England for the artistic illustration
of a daily paper. The <i>Daily Graphic</i> was illustrated, but its draughtsmen
were trained to adapt their drawings to the printer. The scheme
now was to oblige the printer to adapt himself to the illustrator. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
illustrator of note in London contributed. Burne-Jones' frontispiece
to William Morris' <i>News from Nowhere</i> was enlarged and printed
successfully. J. asked Whistler to let him try the experiment of
enlarging one of the Thames etchings. Whistler was interested.
<i>Black Lion Wharf</i> was selected and printed in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>,
February 22, 1895, the very day of the month, Washington's Birthday,
when, ten years later, the London Memorial Exhibition opened. With
its publication the success of the series was complete, not politically,
for the twenty-four drawings were said to have lost the Progressives
twenty-five seats. The etching stood the enlarging superbly. J. made
the proprietors pay for the print, the first time Whistler was paid for
the use of one of his works not made as an illustration.</p>

<p>Whistler came to us almost daily. Late one afternoon he brought
his transfer-paper, and made a lithograph of J. as he sprawled comfortably,
and uncomfortably had to keep the pose, in an easy-chair
before the fire. Whistler made four portraits in succession of J. and
one of E., each in an afternoon. He drew on as the light faded, and
the portrait of E. was done while the firelight flickered on her face
and on his paper. Then he told us he had taken a studio in Fitzroy
Street to paint a large full-length of J. in a Russian cloak&mdash;<i>The Russian
Schube</i>&mdash;which he thought the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts
might like to have. But J. was called away, Mrs. Whistler grew rapidly
worse, the scheme was dropped never to be taken up again.</p>

<p>On other afternoons he and J. would go to Way's, where the Savoy
drawings were put on the stone. The lithotint of <i>The Thames</i> was
done on a stone sent to the hotel. Drawings made in Paris, Lyme
Regis, London were transferred and gone all over with chalk, stump,
scraper. He worked in a little room adjoining Mr. Way's office, the
walls of which were covered with pastels and water-colours by him
and C. E. Holloway. There he drew the portraits of Mr. Thomas
Way in the firelight, never stopping until dark, when Mr. Way would
bring out some rare old liqueur, and there was a rest before he hurried
back to the Savoy. His nights were spent sitting up by his wife. He
slept a little in the morning and usually came to us in the afternoon,
at times so exhausted that we feared more for him than for her.</p>

<p>The studio at No. 8 Fitzroy Street was a huge place at the back
of the house, one flight up, reached by a ramshackle glass-roofed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
passage. The portrait of Mr. Pollitt was started and one of Mr.
Robert Barr's daughter, which has disappeared. Mr. Cowan sat again,
and another was begun of Mr. S. R. Crockett, who describes the sittings:</p>

<p>"I don't think he liked me at first. Someone had told him I was
a Philistine of Askelon.... He told me lots about his early times
in London and Paris, but all in fragments, just as the thing occurred
to him. Like an idiot, I took no notes. Lots, too, about Carlyle
and his sittings, as likely to interest a Scot. He had got on unexpectedly
well with True Thomas, chiefly by letting him do the talking, and never
opening his mouth, except when Carlyle wanted him to talk. Carlyle
asked him about Paris, and was unexpectedly interested in the <i>cafés</i>,
and so forth. Whistler told him the names of some&mdash;Riche, Anglais,
Véfour, and Foyot and Lavenue on the south side. Carlyle seemed
to be mentally taking notes. Then he suddenly raised his head and
demanded, 'Can a man get a chop there?'</p>

<p>"Concerning my own sittings, he was very particular that I should
always be in good form&mdash;'trampling' as he said&mdash;otherwise he would
tell me to go away and play.... Mr. Fisher Unwin had arranged
for a lithograph, but Whistler said he would make a picture like a postage
stamp, and next year all the exhibitions would be busy as anthills
with similar 'postage stamp' portraits. 'Some folk think life-size
means six foot by three; I'll show them!' he said more than once.
I wanted to shell out as he went on, and once, being flush (new book
or something), I said I had fifty pounds which was annoying me, and
I wished he would take it. He was very sweet about it, and said he
understood. Money burnt a hole in his pocket, too, but he could
not take any money, as he might never finish the work. Any day his
brush might drop, and he could not do another stroke.</p>

<p>"It was a bad omen! His wife grew worse. He sent me word
not to come. She died, and I never saw him after. I wish you could
tell me what became of that picture. He called it <i>The Grey Man</i>."</p>

<p>This is another example of Whistler's repetition of titles. Mr.
Cowan's portrait, painted the same year, was <i>The Grey Man</i> too. Of
Mr. Crockett's, Whistler said to us that Crockett was delighted with it
as far as it had gone, and he was rather pleased with it himself. He
painted several of these small full-lengths, which were to show the
fallacy of the life-size theory and of the belief that the importance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
a portrait depends on the size of the canvas. Kennedy, after the
portrait destroyed in Paris, stood for a second, now in the Metropolitan
Museum; Mr. Arnold Hannay for another; C. E. Holloway for <i>The
Philosopher</i>, which Whistler considered particularly successful.</p>

<p>In the spring Whistler moved his wife from the Savoy to St. Jude's
Cottage, Hampstead Heath, rented from Canon and Mrs. Barnett. After
this he began to give up hope. It was a sad day when for the first time
he admitted, "We are very, very bad." And we understood that the
end was near the afternoon when he, the most fastidious, appeared
wearing one black and one brown shoe, and explaining that he had a
corn. But, indeed, many times it seemed as if in his despair he did
not know what he was doing. The last day Mr. Sydney Pawling met
him walking, running across the Heath, looking at nothing, seeing
no one. Mr. Pawling, alarmed, stopped him. "Don't speak! Don't
speak! It is terrible!" he said, and was gone. That was the end.</p>

<p>Mrs Whistler died on May 10 and was buried at Chiswick on the
14th. We have heard that the funeral was arranged for the 13th,
but Whistler, objecting to the date, postponed it a day, and Mrs.
Whistler was buried on her birthday. He never would do anything on
the 13th if he could help it.</p>

<p>We were abroad, but the first Sunday after E.'s return he came
and asked her to go with him to the National Gallery. There he
showed her the pictures "Trixie" loved, standing long before Tintoretto's
<i>Milky Way</i>, her favourite. There was no talk about pictures&mdash;Canaletto
was barely looked at&mdash;there was no talk about anything,
and the tragedy that could not be forgotten was never referred to.
But M. Paul Renouard was in the Gallery and came to Whistler with
the word of comfort, from which he shrank. During the first few
months after Mrs. Whistler's death, in the shock of his sorrow and
loss, Whistler made her sister, Miss Rosalind Birnie Philip, his ward,
and drew up a new will appointing her his heiress and executrix;
eventually cancelling his former bequests, and leaving everything to
her absolutely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX: ALONE.<br /> THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETY-SIX.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> stayed a short time at Hampstead with his sisters-in-law,
and then went to Mr. Heinemann at Whitehall Court, where he
remained, on and off, for two or three years, spending only the periods
of Mr. Heinemann's absence at Garlant's Hotel or in Paris. He was
with us day after day. Little notes came from the studio to ask if
we would be in and alone in the evening, and, if so, he would dine
with us. At first he would not join us if we expected anyone. He
liked to sit and talk, he said, but he could not meet other people. He
saw few outside the studio, except Mr. Heinemann, Mr. Kennedy,
and ourselves. We went to the studio, and often he and J. sketched
together in the streets.</p>

<p>For these sketching expeditions Whistler prepared beforehand the
colours he wanted to use, and if the day turned out too grey or too
radiant for his scheme nothing was done. The chosen colours were
mixed, and little tubes, filled with them, were carried in his small
paint-box, which held also the tiny palette with the pure colours
arranged on it, his brushes, and two or three small panels. Many
studies were made. The most important was of St. John's, Westminster.
He loved the quiet corner, now destroyed, and he went
there many times. He worked away, his top hat jammed down on
his nose, sitting on a three-legged stool, his paint-box on his knee,
the panel in it, beginning at once in colour on the panel, usually finishing
the sketch in one afternoon, though he took two over the church.
The painting was simply done, commencing with the point of interest,
the masses put in bigly, the details worked into them. Just as in the
studio, five minutes after he had begun he became so absorbed in his
work that he forgot everything else until it grew too dark to see. When
ladies would come and recognise him, he stopped, got up, and spoke to
them, always charmingly.</p>

<p>He made little journeys during the summer, one to Rochester
and Canterbury, with Mrs. Whibley and Miss Birnie Philip. But,
disgusted with the inns and the food, he came back after a day or
so. Another was with Mr. Kennedy, who writes us:</p>

<p>"It was agreed that Whistler and myself should go to France.
Neither of us had any idea <i>where</i> we were going except to Havre.
We arrived in the early morning, and after he got shaved and had coffee,
we took the boat to Honfleur, which, as you know, has a tidal service.
'Do you know where we are going?' I said to him. 'No, I don't,'
said he. 'Well,' said I, 'there is a white-whiskered, respectable-looking
old gentleman; perhaps he knows the lay of the ground. Tip
him a stave.'</p>

<p>"So Whistler asked him about the hotels in Honfleur. There were
two&mdash;the Cheval Blanc on the quay, and the Ferme de St. Siméon
on the outskirts. The Cheval was so dirty that I got the only cab,
and, piling the luggage on it ourselves, drove off to the farm. Fortunately,
there were two vacant rooms, and we stayed there a week.
The cooking was excellent, and, of course, <i>Madame</i> knew who <i>Monsieur
Vistlaire</i> was. Whistler used to kick up a row every night with me
about the 'ridiculous British' to divert his mind, I imagine, and sometimes
my retorts were so sharp that I said to myself, 'All is over between
us now.' But he used to bob up serenely in the morning, as if nothing
had happened, and after <i>déjeuner</i> he would take his small box of colours
and paint in the large church. I used to stroll about the town and look
in occasionally to see that he came to no harm. It was here that he
said he was going over to Rome some day, and when I said, 'Don't
forget to let me know, so that I may be on hand to see you wandering
up the aisle in sackcloth and ashes, with a candle in each hand, or
scrubbing the floor!' he said, in a tone of horrified astonishment,
'Good God! O'K.,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
is it possible? Why, I thought they would make me a hell of a swell of
an abbot, or something like that.'</p>

<p>"It was amusing to see him man&oelig;uvre to get near the big kitchen
fire, overcoat on. He was a true American in his liking for heat, and
the way he would sidle into the kitchen, which opened on out-of-doors,
all the time mildly flattering <i>Madame</i>, was very characteristic. We
went to Trouville one day on the diligence, and had a capital <i>déjeuner</i>
at the Café de Paris, before which Whistler said, 'We must do this
<i>en Prince</i>, O'K.!' 'All right, your Highness, I'm with you!' Afterwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
on the beach, he went to sleep on a chair, leaning back against
a bath-house, his straw hat tipped on his nose. It was funny, but sleep
after luncheon was a necessity to him. Coming back to London, in
the harbour of Southampton, after listening to the usual unwearying
talk against the British, I said, 'Oh, be reasonable!' 'Why should
I?' said he."</p>

<p>The Ferme de St. Siméon has been called the Cradle of Impressionism.
It was here that Boudin lived and most of the Impressionists
came, and round about they found their subjects.</p>

<p>Later on Whistler spent a few days at Calais in the Meurice, Sterne's
Hotel, where he was miserable. Then he tried to find J. at Whitby,
where they missed each other, and where he said the glitter of the
windows made the town look like the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Whistler recovered slowly, and journeys helped him less than work
in the studio, where, by degrees, he returned to the schemes so sadly
interrupted. We remember his coming to us with Mr. Kennedy
one Sunday afternoon, bringing up our three flights of stairs <i>The
Master Smith</i> to show it to us once again before it went to America.
Mr. Kennedy had captured it, fearful of a touch being added. It was
placed on one chair, Whistler, on another facing it, wretched at the
thought of parting with it. It was always a wrench to let a picture go.</p>

<p>After a while he did not mind meeting a few people. A man he
liked to see was Timothy Cole. There was a great scheme that he
should make a series of drawings on wood and Cole engrave them.
Cole brought the blocks prepared for him to draw on. But that is
the last we or Cole heard about it, though we saw the blocks frequently
at Fitzroy Street. Mr. Cole says:</p>

<p>"I did not speak to him more than once after I had given him the
wood blocks. I did not think it prudent to press him about the matter,
fearing he might get disgusted and give it up.... The blocks were
the size of the <i>Century</i> page."</p>

<p>Cole gave Whistler some of his prints, and they pleased Whistler
very much, though he rarely cared to own the pictures and prints of
other artists. Once when an etcher gave him a not very wonderful
proof, he tore it up, saying, "I do not collect etchings, I make them!
I do not collect the works of my contemporaries!" With the exception
of his portrait by Boxall we never saw a scrap of anyone else's work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
about his studio or his house, save the forgery someone sent him which
he kept and hung for a while. Another side to Mr. Cole was his endless
practical jokes. He used to do extraordinary things, to Whistler's
amusement. On one point only they were not in sympathy:  Mr.
Cole's theories of diet. One evening at dinner Cole told us that he
and his family were living chiefly on rhubarb tops, they have such
a "foody" taste, his son thought. "Dear me, poor fellow," said
Whistler, "it sounds as if once, long long ago, he had really eaten,
and still has a dim memory of what food is!" "And spinach," Cole
added, "it's fine. We eat it raw, it's wonderful the things it does for
you!" "But what does it do for you?" Whistler asked, and Cole
began a dissertation on the juices of the stomach. "Well, you know,"
Whistler told him, "when you begin to talk about the stomach and its
juices, it's time to stop dining." After that, Cole managed to dismiss
his theories and dine like other people when with us.</p>

<p>Professor John Van Dyke was in London that fall, and Whistler
was willing to come to meet him. A long darn in a tablecloth afterwards
bore witness to the animation of one of those dinners&mdash;Whistler's
knife brought down sharply on the table to emphasise his argument.
The subject was <i>Las Meniñas</i>, which he had never seen, which everyone
else had seen. Velasquez painted the picture just as you see it, he
maintained; no one agreed. Perspectives and plans were drawn on
the unfortunate cloth, chairs were pushed back, the situation grew
critical. Whistler was forced to yield slowly, when, of a sudden, his
eyes fell on Van Dyke's feet in long, pointed shoes, then the American
fashion, their points carried to a degree of fineness no English bootmaker
could rival. "My God, Van Dyke, where did you get your shoes?"
Whistler asked. We could not go on fighting after that; defeat was
avoided. Though Whistler had never been to Madrid, it seemed as
if he had seen the pictures, so familiar was he with them, and though
he was at times not right about them, his interest was endless. We
remember "Bob" Stevenson telling him, to his great delight, how,
one summer day with J. in the Long Gallery of the Prado where <i>Las
Meniñas</i> then hung, an old peasant dressed in faded blue-green came
and sat down on the green bench in front, and straightway he became
part of the picture, so true was its atmosphere. There are legends
of Whistler's descent into a <i>Casa des Huespedes</i> in Madrid with Sargent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
and J., but J. never was there and Sargent denies it. It is another
legend. Whistler could get more from a glance at a photograph than
most painters from six months' copying.</p>

<p>Another evening Claude was the subject&mdash;Claude compared to
Turner. Whistler could never see the master Englishman adored in
Turner; not because of Ruskin, for Mr. Walter Greaves told us that
years before the Ruskin trial Whistler "reviled Turner." Mr. Cole
in 1896 was engraving Turners in the National Gallery, and Whistler
insisted on their inferiority to the Claudes, so amazingly demonstrated
in Trafalgar Square, where Turner invited the comparison disastrous
to him. The argument grew heated, and Whistler adjourned it until
the next morning, when he arranged to meet Cole and J. in the Gallery.
Whistler compared the work of the two artists hanging side by side,
as Turner wished:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, you have only to look. Claude is the artist
who knows there is no painting the sun itself, and so he chooses the
moment after the sun has set, or has hid behind a cloud, and its light
fills the sky, and that light he suggests as no other painter ever could.
But Turner must paint nothing less than the sun, and he sticks on a blob
of paint&mdash;let us be thankful that it isn't a red wafer, as in some of his
other pictures&mdash;and there isn't any illusion whatever, and the Englishman
lifts up his head in ecstatic conceit with the English painter, who
alone has dared to do what no artist would ever be fool enough to
attempt! And look at the architecture. Claude could draw a classical
building as it is; Turner must invent, imagine architecture as no
architect could design it, and no builder could put it up, and as it never
would stand up&mdash;the old amateur!"</p>

<p>They went on to the Canalettos and Guardis Whistler could not
weary of&mdash;to Canaletto's big red church and the tiny Rotunda at Vauxhall
with the little figures, from which Hogarth learned so much.
Whistler always acknowledged Guardi's influence, though it had not led
him in Venice to paint pictures like Guardi or Canaletto either. And he
never tired of pointing out that great artists like Guardi and Canaletto
and Velasquez, who were born and worked in the South, did not try to
paint sunlight, but kept their work grey and low in tone. That day at
the National Gallery, before he could finish explaining the similarity
between his work and Guardi's, the talk came to an end, for half the
copyists in the room had left their easels. He stopped. He could
not talk to an audience which he was not sure was sympathetic. Sure
of sympathy, he would talk for ever in praise of the luminosity of
Claude, the certainty of Canaletto, the wonderful tone of Guardi,
the character and colour of Hogarth. Another Italian about whom
he was enthusiastic was Michael Angelo Caravaggio, admiring his things
in the Louvre. Whistler maintained that the exact knowledge, the
science, of the Old Masters was the reason of their greatness. The
modern painter has a few tricks, a few fads; these give out, and nothing
is left. Knowledge is inexhaustible. Tintoretto did not find his way
until he was forty. Titian was painting in as masterly a manner in
his last year as in his youth. And speaking of the cleverness&mdash;a term he
hated&mdash;of the modern man, he said:</p>

<p>"Think of the finish, the delicacy, the elegance, the repose of a
little Terborgh, Vermeer, Metsu. These were masters who could
paint interiors, chandeliers, and all the rest; and what a difference
between them and the clever little interiors now!"</p>

<p>In the autumn Whistler established Miss Birnie Philip and her
mother in the Rue du Bac and returned to Mr. Heinemann's flat at
Whitehall Court, making it so much his home that before long he was
laughingly alluding to "my guest Heinemann." It is not likely that
the two would ever have parted had not Mr. Heinemann married
and even then Whistler stayed with him as long as his health remained
good, dependent on the friendship formed late in life with a man
many years younger. When Mr. Heinemann was away he complained
that London was duller and blacker than ever. Whistler shrank from
condolence in his great grief or from a revival of the memories of those
terrible weeks. His host was careful or we would invite Whistler to
us if anybody was expected at Whitehall Court. After three or four
years Mr. Heinemann's married life ended abruptly, and Whistler at
once suggested that they should go back to the old way. Mr. Heinemann
took another flat in Whitehall Court with this idea. But before
the plan could be realised Whistler died.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1896 Mr. Henry Savage Landor, back from
Japan and Korea, also stayed with Mr. Heinemann; "a rare fellow,
full of real affection," Whistler said of him. They sat up for hours
together night after night. Whistler slept badly, and Mr. Landor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
can do with less sleep than most people. There was a skull in the
drawing-room that Mr. Landor tells us Whistler sketched over and
over again, while they talked till morning. When they drew the curtains
it was day; then Whistler dressed, breakfasted, and went to the studio.
He brought us stories of Mr. Landor; the way in which he would
start for the ends of the earth as if to stroll in Piccadilly, "leaving the
costume of travel to the Briton crossing the Channel"; or, in light
shoes, "outwalk the stoutest-shod gillie over Scotch moors." Then
Whistler brought us Mr. Landor, with whom our friendship dates from
the morning when, at Whistler's request, he sat Japanese fashion on
the floor in front of our fire, a rug wrapped round him for kimono,
and devoured imaginary rice with pencils for chopsticks. When Mr.
Landor had his horrible experiences in Thibet and the story of his
tortures was telegraphed to Europe, Whistler was the first to send
him a cable rejoicing at his escape. Whistler also took a fancy while
in Whitehall Court to Mr. Heinemann's brother Edmund who was,
Whistler said, "something in the City," who saw to one or two investments
for him, and whom he christened the "Napoleon of Finance"
and described as "sitting in a tangled web of telegraphs and telephones."
He never had invested money before, and it was with pride that he
deposited at the bank his scrip and collected his dividends. To end
a discussion about the City Mr. Edmund Heinemann once said to him,
"You ain't on the Stock Exchange!" "Well," said Whistler, "you
just thank your stars, Eddy, I ain't, because if I was there wouldn't
be much room for you! What!"</p>

<p>Evening after evening he would linger in the studio until he could
see no longer; keeping dinner waiting at Whitehall Court, so that no
time could ever be fixed. Arriving, he would mix cocktails, an art
in which he excelled and must have learned in the days when he stayed
away from the Coast Survey. If it did not suit him to dine at Whitehall
Court he would write or wire to say he could dine with us if we liked;
or that he had amazing things to tell us; should he come? or that he
was sure we were both wanting to see him; or Heinemann's servant,
Payne, would announce his coming; or he would drive straight from
the studio, reaching us sometimes before the notes he had sent, or with
the wires unsent in his pocket; almost the only time we have known
him willingly not to dress for dinner. On rare occasions he came in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
after we had dined, demanded the <i>fortune du pot</i> of our small establishment,
and was content no matter how meagre that fortune might prove,
though if it included "a piece of American cake," or anything sweet,
he was better pleased. He grumbled only over our Sunday supper,
which was cold in English fashion, out of deference to Bowen, our
old English servant. Then he would bring Constant, his valet, model,
and cook, to make an onion soup or an omelette. Constant was
succeeded by a little Belgian called Marie, who was supposed to look
after the studio, and who, when he stayed at Garlant's and we dined
with him there, would be summoned to dress the salad and make the
coffee. It was not long after this that, by the doctor's advice, he gave
up coffee and stopped smoking too. Few men ever ate less than Whistler,
but few were more fastidious about what they did eat. He made the
best of our English cooking while it lasted, but he was glad when Bowen
was replaced by Louise and then Augustine, who were French and who
could make the soups, salads, and dishes he liked, and who did not
hesitate to scold him when he was late and ruined the dinner.</p>

<p>These meetings must have been pleasant to Whistler as to us;
there were weeks when he came every evening. On his arrival he might
be silent, but after his nap he would begin talking, and his talk was
as good on the last evening with us as on the first. We shall always
regret that we made no notes of what he said, though the charm of his
talk would have eluded a shorthand reporter. Much can never be
forgotten. In "surroundings of antagonism" he wrapped this talk
as well as himself in "a species of misunderstanding" and deliberately
mystified, bewildered, and aggravated the company. But when disguise
was not necessary, and he talked at his ease, he impressed everyone
with his sanity of judgment, breadth of interest, and keenness of intellect.
His reading was extensive, though we never ceased to wonder
when he found time for it, save during sleepless nights. His talk
abounded in quotations, especially from the Bible, that "splendid mine
of invective," he described it. His diversity of knowledge was as unexpected
as his extensive reading, and we felt that he knew things intuitively,
just as by some uncanny faculty he heard everything said about
him. When he chose he held the floor and was then at his best. "I am
not arguing with you, I am telling you," he would say, and he would lose
his temper, which was violent as ever, but he was friendlier than before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
when it was over. He liked to hear the last gossip, and reproached us
if we had none for him. More than once he told E. her discretion
amounted positively to indiscretion; he was sure she had a cupboard
full of skeletons, and some day, when she was pulling the strings of one
carefully to put it back in place, the whole lot would come rattling down
about her ears. And so, the shadow of sorrow in the background,
the evenings went by that winter in the little dining-room which had
been Etty's studio where the huge Edinburgh pictures were painted.</p>

<p>The Eden affair was still dragging on, and Whistler was disgusted
to find English artists as afraid to support him as at the Ruskin trial.
One day in Bond Street he met a Follower, just returned to town,
arm-on-arm with "the Baronet." The Follower at once left a card
at Fitzroy Street. Whistler wrote "Judas Iscariot" on it and sent
it back to him. A few weeks later the New English Art Club hung
Sir William Eden's work, and with it, he said, "their shame, upon
their walls." He complimented them, much to their discomfort, on
their appetite for "toad." To clear the air, which had become sultry
in the art clubs and studios, we invited Professor Fred Brown and Dr.
D. S. MacColl to meet him one evening at dinner, and discuss things.
Professor Brown had another engagement. Dr. MacColl came, and
Whistler, who did not mind how hard a man fought if he fought at all,
continued on terms with him. But the New English Art Club he
never forgave.</p>

<p>A show of J.'s lithographs of Granada and the Alhambra was
arranged at the Fine Art Society's during December 1896, and for the
catalogue Whistler wrote an introductory note, and another for a show
of Phil May's drawings in the same gallery. He designed the cover
for Mr. Charles Whibley's <i>Book of Scoundrels</i>, and also two covers for
novels by Miss Elizabeth Robins, <i>Below the Salt</i>, for which he drew
a silver ship, and <i>The Open Question</i>, for which he devised shields;
all three books published by Mr. Heinemann. The design for the
<i>Book of Scoundrels</i> was a gallows, drawn in thin lines, with rope and
noose attached. Henley, to whom it was shown, asked whether the
gallows should not have been drawn with a support. Whistler's
comment was: "Well, you know, that's the usual sort of gallows, but
this one will do. It will hang all of us. Just like Henley's selfishness
to want a strong one!" an allusion to Henley's size.</p>

<p>During the winter Whistler met Sir Seymour Haden for the last
time at a dinner given by the Society of Illustrators (of which both
were Vice-Presidents) to Mr. Alfred Parsons, on his election to the
Royal Academy. It was Whistler's first appearance in public since
his wife's death, and as we had persuaded him to go, never anticipating
any such meeting, we were annoyed to think that we had exposed
him to the unpleasantness of it, or Haden either, for we had had no
part in their quarrels. However, as soon as Whistler saw Haden he
woke up and began to enjoy himself. His laugh carried far. Haden
heard it, and may have seen the three monocles on the dinner-table.
He looked toward the laugh, dropped his spoon in his soup-plate, and
left. Later Whistler was called upon to make a speech and could not
get out of it. But it was an anti-climax. The event of the dinner
was over.</p>

<p>At Christmas he went with Mr. and Mrs. T. Fisher Unwin and
ourselves to Bournemouth, where our hotel was an old-fashioned inn,
selected from the guide-book because it was the nearest to the sea. We
breakfasted in our rooms, we met at lunch to order dinner, and the rest
of the day Whistler insisted must be spent getting an appetite for it&mdash;wandering
on the cliffs, he with his little paint-box. But the sea was
on the wrong side, the wind blew the wrong way, he could do nothing.
Some days we took long drives. One damp, cold, cheerless afternoon
we stopped at a small inn in Poole. The landlady, watching Whistler
sip his hot whisky and water, was convinced he was somebody, but was
unable to place him. "And who do you suppose I am?" Whistler
asked at last. "I can't exactly say, sir, but I should fancy you was
from the 'Alls!" Aubrey Beardsley was then at Boscombe, a further
stage in his brave fight with death, and we went to see him. But the
sight of the suffering of others was too cruel a reminder to Whistler,
and he shrank from going to Beardsley.</p>

<p>Dinner was the event of the day, and it would have proved a disaster
had Whistler not seen humour in being expected to eat it, so little
was it what he thought a dinner should be. On Christmas Day he
was melancholy and stared at the turkey and bread sauce, the sodden
potatoes and soaked greens: "To think of my beautiful room in the
Rue du Bac, and the rest of them there, eating their Christmas dinner,
having up my wonderful old Pouilly from my cellar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>But we had something else to talk about. In the <i>Saturday Review</i>
of that week, December 26, there was an article, signed Walter
Sickert, that was of interest to us all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL: THE LITHOGRAPH CASE.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-SIX AND EIGHTEEN NINETY-SEVEN.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sickert's</span> article was ostensibly inspired by the show of J.'s
lithographs of Granada at the Fine Art Society's, which Whistler had
introduced. Whistler understood it to be an attack upon himself, as
well as upon J., whose lithographs alone it pretended to deal with. As
a rule, Whistler's lithographs were made on lithographic paper and
transferred to the stone. The article argued that to pass off drawings
made on paper as lithographs was as misleading to "the purchaser on
the vital point of commercial value" as to sell photogravures for
etchings, which, when Sir Hubert Herkomer had done so, led to a
protest from J. and Whistler, and also from Mr. Sickert, whose condemnation
had been strong. The article, therefore, was written
either ignorantly or maliciously, for no such distinction in lithography
has ever been made. Transfer-paper is as old as Senefelder, the inventor
of lithography, who looked upon it as the most important part of
his invention. The comment amounted to a charge of dishonesty, and
an apology was demanded by J. The apology was refused by Mr. Frank
Harris, editor of the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and consequently Messrs. Lewis
and Lewis brought an action for libel against writer and editor.</p>

<p>The action stood in J.'s name, and Whistler was the principal witness.
In the hope that the matter might be settled by an apology and
without appeal to the law, Mr. Heinemann arranged a meeting between
the editor of the <i>Saturday Review</i> and Whistler, but nothing came of it.
People who knew nothing of lithography got involved in the case, and
our friend Harold Frederic, for one, entangled himself with the enemy.
Others were found to know a great deal whom we never suspected of
knowing anything, and through Whistler we discovered that Mr.
Alfred Gilbert started life as a lithographer, was indignant with the
<i>Saturday Review</i>, and only too willing to offer his help to us. Meetings
followed on Sunday evenings in the huge Maida Vale house where Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Gilbert was trying to revive mediæval relations between master and
workman and live the life of a craftsman with pupils and assistants,
a brave experiment which ended in failure.</p>

<p>The case was fixed for April 1897, the most inconvenient time of
the year for the artist who exhibits. Whistler was working on the
portrait of Miss Kinsella, and he had promised three pictures to the
<i>Salon: Green and Violet</i>, <i>Rose and Gold</i>, and a Nocturne. M. Helleu,
who was in London, catalogued and measured them, reserving space on
the wall. Only a few days were left before sending in and the work
would never be done in time. Whistler was in despair. It was then, too,
he learned that C. E. Holloway, a distinguished artist whom the world
never knew, was ill in his studio near by. Holloway was anything but
a successful man, and Whistler was shocked to find him in bed, lacking
every comfort. He provided doctors, nurses, medicine, and food,
and looked after the dying man's family. He spent afternoons in
Holloway's tiny bedroom. All this took up time and made it difficult
to get his pictures ready for the <i>Salon</i>.</p>

<p>He called one morning on his way to the studio to tell us of the
death of Holloway. He was going to the funeral, and suggested a fund
to purchase some of the pictures and give the proceeds to the family.
He was nervous and worried, the <i>Salon</i> clamouring for his work on the
one hand, the trial claiming him on the other. People, he complained,
did not seem to understand the importance of his time. Things were
amazing in the studio, and he was expected to leave them just to go into
court. No, he wouldn't, that was the end of it. The pictures must
be finished. J. said to him: "The case is as much yours as mine,
and you must come. Your reputation is involved. There will be
an end to your lithography if we lose. You must fight."</p>

<p>Whistler liked one the better for the contradiction he was supposed
unable to bear, and he answered: "Well, you know, but really&mdash;why,
of course, Joseph, it's all right. I'm coming; of course, we'll fight
it through together. I never meant not to. That's all right."</p>

<p>And to E., who went with him to the "Temple of Pomona" in
the Strand, to order flowers for Holloway, he kept saying: "You
know, really, Joseph mustn't talk like that! Of course, it's all right.
Of course, I never meant not to come. You must tell him it's all
right. I never back out!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>His work stopped. His pictures did not go to Paris. He stood
by us.</p>

<p>The case was tried in the King's Bench Division on April 5, before
Mr. Justice Mathew. We were represented by Sir Edward Clarke, Q.C.,
and Mr. Eldon Bankes. Whistler arrived early. In the great hall he
met the counsel for the other side, Mr. Bigham, an acquaintance, and,
leaning on his arm, entered the court, "capturing the enemy's counsel
on the way," he said, as he sat down between us and Sir George Lewis.
The counsel are now both judges.</p>

<p>J., in the witness-box, pointed out that he had made lithographs
both on paper and on stone; that there was no difference between them,
an historical fact which he was able to prove; that for the defendants
to deny that a lithograph made on paper was as much a lithograph as a
lithograph made on stone showed that they knew nothing about the
subject, or else were acting out of malice.</p>

<p>Whistler was called next. He said his grievance was the accusation
that he pursued the same evil practice. He was asked by Mr. Bigham
if he was very angry with Mr. Sickert, and he replied he might not be
angry with Mr. Sickert, but he was disgusted that "distinguished people
like Mr. Pennell and myself are attacked by an absolutely unknown
authority (Mr. Sickert), an insignificant and irresponsible person."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Bigham, "Mr. Sickert is an insignificant and
irresponsible person who can do no harm?"</p>

<p>Whistler answered: "Even a fool can do harm, and if any harm is
done to Mr. Pennell it is done to me. This is a question for all artists."
And he added that Mr. Sickert's "pretended compliments and
flatteries were a most impertinent piece of insolence, tainted with a
certain obsequious approach."</p>

<p>Further asked if this was his action, he said: "I am afraid if
Mr. Pennell had not taken these proceedings, I should."</p>

<p>"You are working together then?"</p>

<p>"No, we are on the same side."</p>

<p>"Are you bearing any part of the costs?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am quite willing."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Clarke then interposed and asked if there was any
foundation for that question.</p>

<p>"Only the lightness and delicacy of the counsel's suggestion."</p>

<p>At the end of the cross-examination Whistler adjusted his eye-glass,
put his hat on the rail of the witness-box, slowly pulled off one glove
after the other. He turned to the judge and said:</p>

<p>"And now, my Lord, may I tell you why we are all here?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Whistler," said his Lordship; "we are all here because
we cannot help it."</p>

<p>Whistler left the box. What he meant to say no one will ever know.
We asked him later. He shook his head. The moment for saying it
had passed.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney Colvin, Keeper of the Print Room of the British
Museum; Mr. Strange, of the Art Library, South Kensington;
Mr. Way and Mr. Goulding, professional lithographic printers; and
Mr. Alfred Gilbert were our witnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigham said that the case was a storm in a teacup blown up by
Whistler, and that the article could do no harm to anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. Sickert protested that he was familiar with all the processes
of lithography; that the plaintiff's lithographs were not lithographs,
but, as a matter of fact, mere transfers. He had submitted the article
to another paper, which refused it before it was accepted by the <i>Saturday
Review</i>. He had been under the impression that the plaintiff would
like a newspaper correspondence. He was actuated by a pedantic
purism. Cross-examined by Sir Edward Clarke, he had to admit by
implication that he intended to charge the plaintiff with dishonest
practices, and that he had caught Mr. Pennell, the purist, tripping. He
had to admit that the only lithograph he ever published was made in the
same way, and he had called it, or allowed it to be called, a lithograph.</p>

<p>Mr. Sickert's witnesses scarcely helped him. Mr. C. H. Shannon's
testimony was more favourable to us than to him. Mr. Rothenstein
testified that all the lithographs he had published were done exactly
as Whistler and J. had done theirs, and as he came out of the box fell into
his hat. Mr. George Moore solemnly proclaimed that he knew nothing
about lithographs, but that he knew Degas. "What's Degas?"
roared the judge, thinking some new process was being sprung on him,
and Mr. Moore vanished. The editor of the <i>Saturday Review</i> acknowledged
that he had published an illustrated supplement full of lithographs
done on transfer-paper and advertised by him as lithographs;
that he had not known what was in Mr. Sickert's article until it appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>The judge, in summing up, said that a critic might express a most
disparaging opinion on an artist's work and might refer to him in the
most disagreeable terms, but he must not attribute to the artist discreditable
conduct, unless he could prove that his charge was true.
If the jury thought the criticism merely sharp and exaggerated, they
would find a verdict for the defendant, but if not&mdash;that is, if it was more
than this&mdash;they should consider to what damages the plaintiff was
entitled. The verdict was for the plaintiff&mdash;damages fifty pounds, not
a high estimate of the value of artistic morality on the part of the British
jury, but at least, in so far as it carried costs, higher than the estimate
put upon Whistler's work in the Ruskin trial.</p>

<p>So convinced were the other side of a verdict in their favour that
a rumour reached us of a luncheon ordered beforehand at the Savoy,
on the second day, by the editor of the <i>Saturday Review</i> to celebrate
our defeat. We waited to be sure. Then we carried off Whistler,
Mr. Reginald Poole, who had conducted the case for us, and Mr.
Jonathan Sturges to the Café Royal for our breakfast. Whistler was
jubilant, and nothing pleased him more than the deference of the
foreman of the jury, who waylaid him to shake hands at the close of the
trial. And since then no incautious British artists or critics have dared
to tamper with Senefelder's definition of lithography.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI: THE END OF THE EDEN CASE.<br /> THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-SEVEN TO EIGHTEEN NINETY-NINE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> our triumph Whistler went to Paris and Boldini painted his
portrait, shown in the International Exhibition of 1900. It was done
in a very few sittings. Mr. Kennedy, who went with Whistler, says
that Boldini worked rapidly, that Whistler got tired of doing what he
had made other people do all his life&mdash;pose&mdash;and took naps. During
one of these Boldini made a dry-point on a zinc plate. Whistler did not
like it, nor did he like any better Helleu's done at the same time. Of
the painting Whistler said to us, "They say that looks like me, but I
hope I don't look like that!" It is, however, a presentment of him
in his worst mood, and Mr. Kennedy remembers that he was in his worst
mood all the while. It is the Whistler whom the world knew and feared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>When Whistler came back to London, in May or June, he went to
Garlant's Hotel, where Kennedy was staying. Mr. Kennedy's relations
with Whistler commenced by his selling Whistler's prints and pictures
in New York, and then developed into an intimate friendship, which
continued until almost the end of Whistler's life. Kennedy was one
of Whistler's champions in America, devoted and loyal, though the
friendship ended rather abruptly through a regrettable misunderstanding.
After Whistler's death, Kennedy was mainly responsible for the
Grolier Club exhibition and catalogue.</p>

<p>This summer Whistler went to Hampton, where Mr. Heinemann
had taken a cottage. Whistler never liked the country, but, he said,
"I suppose now we'll have to fish for the little gudgeon together from
a chair, with painted corks, like the other Britons."</p>

<p>He took part in the fun. He went to regattas, picnicked, and was
rowed and punted about. At Hampton he met Mr. William Nicholson,
whom Mr. Heinemann had asked down with the idea of his adding
a portrait of Whistler to the series that began with his woodcut of
Queen Victoria in the <i>New Review</i>. Later Mr. Nicholson, in the
Fitzroy Street studio, made a study of Whistler in evening dress,
recalling the <i>Sarasate</i>, and it appeared in the <i>Review</i>.</p>

<p>It was the summer of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Whistler
could not come to us from Garlant's without passing through streets
hung with tawdry wreaths and draggled festoons; Trafalgar Square
buried in platforms, seats, and advertisements, Nelson on his column
peering above. The decorations were an unfailing amusement to
him, an excuse for an estimate of "the Island and the Islander," and
the talk about the British, an annoyance, we are afraid, to some of his
friends and more of his enemies. One evening he sketched for us his
impression of the Square, with Nelson "boarded at last." "You
see," he said, "England expects every Englishman to be ridiculous,"
and the sketch appeared in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>He again went to the Naval Review, and this time saw it from Mr.
George Vanderbilt's yacht. No etchings were made, though we
believe he did a water-colour or pastel. Instead, he wrote some of
his saddest letters, yet he said with a gleam of glee: "It was wonderful,
just like Spain, just like Velasquez at some great function, for there
was Philip," whom Mr. Vanderbilt resembled, as the portrait proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
till he changed and ruined it. "There was the Queen, Mrs.
Vanderbilt; there was I, the Court Painter, and, why, even the
dwarfs," as he described appropriately two well-known Americans on
board.</p>

<p>In July we proposed to cycle across France to Switzerland, and the
night before we started Whistler, M. Boldini, and Mr. Kennedy dined
with us to say good-bye. Boldini was leaving London the next day,
and by the end of the evening Whistler made up his mind to come as
far as Dieppe, and as he would never, if he could help it, go alone, he
decided that Mr. Kennedy must come too. Next morning we all
arrived at the station save Whistler. Even his baggage came, but not
till we were reduced almost to nervous collapse, not till the train was
starting, did he saunter unmoved&mdash;his straw hat over his eyes&mdash;down
the platform, followed humbly by the pompous station-master and
amazed porters, looking for our carriage. No sooner had we started
than he was in the best of spirits and enjoyed every minute of the
journey, most when on the boat he found a camp of enemies also on
the way to Dieppe, to his delight and their discomfort. At Dieppe
we had to get our bicycles through the customs, the others took a cab,
and when we reached the hotel we were received regally and given a
whole suite, Boldini having hinted to the <i>patron</i> we were royalty
travelling incognito, they in attendance. Almost at once Whistler
got out his little colour-box and started for a shop front in a narrow
street he knew. But first he had to find another kind of shop where he
could buy a rosette of the Legion of Honour, for his had been lost or
forgotten, and he would have thought it wanting in respect to appear
without it in France. The shopkeeper, to whom he explained, said,
"All right, <i>monsieur</i>, here is the rosette, but I have heard that story
before." Whistler was furious, but in the end had to laugh. His
dread of illness was again shown, for Beardsley, dying, was in the town,
and without knowing it we passed his window and Beardsley saw us.
When afterwards we called, Whistler refused to come, and it was well
he did. Beardsley, however, was not the only person in Dieppe
Whistler would not meet.</p>

<p>We had only our cycling costumes, we were staying at the Hôtel
Royal. When he came down to dinner, very late of course, he was
correct in evening dress, the rosette in place, and we thought there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
was a suggestion of hesitation, but it was only a suggestion. He gave
his arm to E., who was in short cycling skirt, J. in knickerbockers, and
as we went into the dining-room he turned to her, and, to a question
that had never been asked, answered clearly, "<i>Mais oui, Princesse</i>,"
and after that he had all the attention he wanted. Every tourist
stared, and we were escorted to our seats by the <i>patron</i>, and for the
rest of the evening, when he was not talking to the <i>Princesse</i>, he was
giving good advice to the head waiter. The evening and the night
were diversified periodically by Boldini's practical jokes, which did not
keep Whistler from being down early in the morning to see us off.
"Well, you know, can't I hold something?" he offered, as E. mounted
her bicycle, and as he watched us wheel along the sea-front, he told
Mr. Kennedy, "After all, O'K., ... there's something in it!" We
asked Mr. Kennedy to pay our bill, and M. Boldini had some trouble
with his. The result was that when Whistler and Kennedy counted
up their joint funds, they found they had just about enough money
to get back to London, and they left.</p>

<p>In the autumn Whistler was in Paris, the Eden case in the Cour de
Cassation being fixed for November 17. It was heard before Président
Périvier, Maître Beurdeley for the second time defending Whistler.
Mr. Heinemann came from London, and was with him in court.
Judgment was given on December 2. The affair had been talked about,
and the court was crowded. The judgment went as entirely in Whistler's
favour as, in the Lower Court, it had gone against him. He was to
keep the picture, on condition that he made it unrecognisable as a
portrait of Lady Eden, which had been done; Sir William Eden was
to have the hundred guineas back, which already had been returned
and 5 per cent. interest; Whistler was to pay one thousand francs
damages with interest and the cost of the first trial, and "the Baronet"
to pay the costs of appeal. Mr. MacMonnies, who also was with
Whistler in court, remembers that "it was decided by the judges that
the picture should be produced when needed. Mr. Whistler whispered
in my ear, 'MacMonnies, take the picture and get out with it.' As
we sat under the judges' noses, and the court-room was packed with
admirers and enemies and court officials, I made a distinct spot as I
walked down the aisle with <i>the</i> picture under my arm. And Whistler
showed his admirable generalship in the case, as not one of the <i>gendarmes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
could stop me. So all anybody could do was to watch it disappear
out of the door."</p>

<p>Whistler said to us that the <i>Procureur de la République</i> was splendid;
that the whole affair was a public recognition of his position; that the
trial made history, established a precedent, proving the right of the
artist to his own work; that a new clause had been added to the <i>Code
Napoléon</i>; that he had "wiped up the floor" with "the Baronet" before
all Paris, his intention from the first. He wished it to be known
that in the law of France he would go down with Napoleon:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, take my word for it, Joseph, the first duty of a
good general when he has won his battle is to say so, otherwise the
people, always dull&mdash;the Briton especially&mdash;fail to understand, and it is
an unsettled point in history for ever. Victory is not complete until
the wounded are looked after and the dead counted."</p>

<p>The trial over, he wanted immediately to make a beautiful little
book of it, and he began to arrange the report with his "Reflections"
for publication. During many months proofs of <i>The Baronet and the
Butterfly</i> filled his pockets. As he had read pages of <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>
to Mr. Alan S. Cole, so he read pages of <i>The Baronet and the Butterfly</i>
to us, and sometimes to the Council of the International after the
meetings, a mistake, for there were members who had not the intelligence
to understand it or him. His care was no less than with <i>The
Gentle Art</i>. Every note, every Butterfly, was thought out and placed
properly. "Beautiful, you know. Isn't it beautiful?" he would say,
when a page or a paragraph pleased him, and nothing pleased him more
than the Butterfly following the "Reflection" on page 43. There he
quotes George Moore: "I undertook a journey to Paris in the depth of
winter, had two shocking passages across the Channel <i>and spent twenty-five
pounds</i>. All this worry is the commission I received for my trouble
in the matter."</p>

<p>Whistler's "Reflection" was: "Why, damme, sir! he must have
had a Valentine himself&mdash;the sea-saddened expert." This was followed
by the Butterfly, "splendid&mdash;actually rolling back with laughter, you
know!"</p>

<p>A new feature was the toad printed over the Dedication: "To
those <i>confrères</i> across the Channel who, refraining from intrusive
demonstration, with a pluck and delicacy all their own 'sat tight'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
during the struggle, these decrees of the judges are affectionately
dedicated."</p>

<p>Below, a Butterfly bows and sends its sting to England. The tiny
toad is the only realistic drawing in his books, and to make it realistic
he needed a model. He thought of applying at the Zoological Gardens,
was promised one by Mr. Wimbush, a painter in the same house, and
finally his stepson, Mr. E. Godwin, found one. He put the toad in a
paper box, forgot all about it, and was shocked when he heard it was
dead.</p>

<p>"You know, they say I starved it. Well, it must have caught a
fly or two, and I thought toads lived in stone or amber&mdash;or something&mdash;for
hundreds of years&mdash;don't you know the stories? Perhaps it was
because I hadn't the amber!"</p>

<p><i>The Baronet and the Butterfly</i> was published in Paris by Henry May,
May 13, 1899. Whistler objected to the date, but on the 13th it
appeared, and the result justified his superstition. It did not attract
much attention. When we saw him in Paris that month he seemed to
think the fault was with the critics who were keeping up the played-out
business of "misunderstanding and misrepresentation." But the
interest in the Eden trial had never been as great as he fancied, and
the report is dull reading, because there were no witnesses and so no
cross-examination which would in England have given him the opportunity
of "scalping" his victim. The Ruskin trial in <i>The Gentle
Art</i> is full of Whistler's answers in court; <i>The Baronet and the Butterfly</i>
is made up of the speeches of advocates and judges. In the marginal
notes, the Dedication, the Argument, he is brilliant and witty, and
the Butterfly as gay as ever. There is no Whistler in the speeches, that
is the trouble.</p>

<p>The book was one of many schemes that occupied him during these
years. The International Society of Sculptors, Painters, and Gravers
was organised, and the <i>Atelier Carmen</i> in Paris was planned, both so
important that their history is reserved for other chapters. A venture
from which he hoped great things was his endeavour to dispense with
the middleman in art. Hitherto he had been glad to trust his affairs to
dealers. "I will lay the golden eggs, you will supply the incubator,"
he told one, whose version of the arrangement was that when the incubator
was ready Whistler would not give up the golden eggs. He could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
not reconcile himself to the large sums gained by buying and selling
his work since 1892. Over the sale of old work he had no control; the
sale of new he determined to keep in his hands. He would be his own
agent, set up his own shop, form a trust in Whistlers. We think it
was in 1896 he first spoke to us about it, delighted, sure he was to
succeed financially at last. In 1897 rumours were spread of a "Whistler
Syndicate." In 1898 advertisements of the "Company of the Butterfly"
appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i>&mdash;the Company composed, as far as we
knew, of James McNeill Whistler. Two rooms were taken on the first
floor at No. 2 Hinde Street, Manchester Square, close to the Wallace
Gallery. They were charming. A few prints were hung. A picture or
two stood on easels. To go to Whistler in the studio for his work was
one thing; it was quite another to go to a shop run by no one knew
who, half the time shut, and deserted when open. We doubt if
anything was ever sold there, we never saw a visitor in the place. Soon
the rooms were turned over to Mr. Heinemann for a show of Mr.
Nicholson's colour-prints, and after that no more was heard of the
"Company of the Butterfly."</p>

<p>There was another reason for starting it. So many people came to
the studio for so many reasons that he had to keep them out, and his
idea was that those who wanted to buy pictures should go to the "Company
of the Butterfly," and buy them there without interrupting him.
But no shop could dispose of the constant visits from the curious, from
photographers asking for his portrait, journalists begging for an interview,
literary people anxious to make articles or books about him. They
would write to arrange a certain hour and appear without waiting for
a reply. One, who had written to say he was coming with a letter of
introduction, on his arrival found the door fastened and heard Whistler
whistling inside, and that was all the indignant visitor heard or saw of
him. There is a story of an American collector who, calling one day
when not wanted, and after wasting much time, asked:</p>

<p>"How much for the whole lot, Mr. Whistler?"</p>

<p>"Five millions."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"My posthumous prices!"</p>

<p>And there are stories of Whistler's ways of meeting the hordes who
tried to force themselves into the studio. Mr. Eddy tells one:</p>

<p>"An acquaintance had brought, without invitation, a friend, 'a distinguished
and clever woman,' to the studio in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs.
They reached the door, both out of breath from their
long climb. 'Ah, my dear Whistler,' drawled C&mdash;&mdash;, 'I have taken
the liberty of bringing Lady D&mdash;&mdash; to see you. I knew you would be
delighted.' 'Delighted, I'm sure! Quite beyond expression, but'&mdash;mysteriously,
and holding the door so as to bar their entrance&mdash;'my
dear Lady D&mdash;&mdash;, I would never forgive our friend for bringing
you up six flights of stairs on so hot a day to visit a studio at one of
these&mdash;eh&mdash;pagan moments when'&mdash;and he glanced furtively behind
him, and still further closed the door&mdash;'it is absolutely impossible for
a lady to be received. Upon my soul, I should never forgive him.'
And Whistler bowed them down from the top of the six flights and
returned to the portrait of a very sedate old gentleman who had taken
advantage of the interruption to break for a moment the rigour of his
pose."</p>

<p>The "Company of the Butterfly" never relieved him of the visitors
who were more eager to see him than his work. But this he did not
discover until he had devoted to the venture far more time than he
had to spare during the crowded years of its existence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII: BETWEEN LONDON AND PARIS.<br />THE
YEARS EIGHTEEN NINETY-SEVEN TO NINETEEN
HUNDRED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his marriage Whistler was unfortunate in his choice of apartments
and studios. The Studio in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs,
on the sixth floor, was the worst for a man with a weak heart to climb
to; the apartment in the Rue du Bac, low and damp, was as bad for
a man who caught cold easily. He was constantly ill during the winter
of 1897-98, which he passed mostly in Paris. Influenza kept him in
bed in November, from January to March he was dull and listless as
never before, save in Venice after the <i>scirocco</i>; he said, "I am so tired&mdash;I
who am never tired!"</p>

<p>Whistler's heart, always weak, began to trouble him. He had been
ill before, but, nervous as he was about his health, he never realised his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
condition. We have known him, when too ill to work, get up out of
bed in order to accomplish something important. A few years before,
confined with quinsy to his brother's house, forced to write what he
wished to say on a slate, when someone he did not want to see was
announced, he forgot that he could not talk and yelled, "Send him
away!" We have known, too, an invitation to dinner from a certain
rich American to rout him out of bed and to cure him temporarily.
It was this endeavour never to be ill, never to give in, that was one
of the causes of his final breakdown. Illness suggested death, and no
man ever shrank more from the thought or mention of death than
Whistler. There was in life so much for him to do, so little time in
which to do it. He would tell his brother it was useless for doctors
to know so much if they had not discovered the elixir of life. "Why
not try to find it?" he asked the Doctor. "Isn't it in the heart of the
unknown? It must be there."</p>

<p>In the studio he worked harder than ever. Illness made him foresee
that his time was short, and he was goaded by the thought of the things
to finish. When he was in London we were distressed by his fatigue
at the end of the day, but he said he was like the old cart-horse that
could keep going as long as it was in traces, but must drop the minute
it was free. While he was in Paris, his letters were full of the "amazing
things" going on in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. He said:
"Really, you know, I could almost laugh at the extraordinary progress
I am making, and the lovely things I am inventing&mdash;work beyond
anything I have ever done before."</p>

<p>He was only beginning to know and to understand, he told us.
All that had gone before was experimental.</p>

<p>There were new portraits. In 1897 he had begun one of Mr.
George Vanderbilt&mdash;"The Modern Philip"&mdash;a full-length in riding
habit, whip in hand, standing against a dark background. The canvas
was sent from Paris to London, just as Whistler and Vanderbilt happened
to be in one place or the other. Not one of his portraits of men interested
Whistler so much; certainly not one was finer when we first
saw it in London, but it was a wreck in the Paris Memorial Exhibition of
1905. Like others of this period, it had been worked over. He painted
Mrs. Vanderbilt, <i>Ivory and Gold</i>, shown in the <i>Salon</i> of 1902, one of the
first of the several ovals he was now doing. Carmen, his model, sat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Portraits started a year or so later were of his brother-in-law, Mr. Birnie
Philip, and of Mr. Elwell, an American painter whom he had known
for some time. In May 1898, in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs,
he showed us the full-length of himself in long overcoat, called <i>Gold and
Brown</i> in the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900 and, as we have said,
never seen afterward. We own a pen-drawing he made of it. It was
far from successful, and before he finished it Miss Marian Draughn, an
American, began to pose for him&mdash;his "Coon Girl" he called her. She
was sent to him by Gibson and Phil May.</p>

<p>He painted many children. He loved children. Ernest G. Brown
remembered Whistler's thoughtfulness and consideration when his
daughter sat for <i>Pretty Nelly Brown</i>, one of the most beautiful of the
series. We have the same story from Mr. Croal Thomson, of whose
daughter, <i>Little Evelyn</i>, Whistler made a lithograph. When he went
to her father's house at Highgate, Evelyn would run to meet him with
outstretched hands, her face lifted to be kissed, and while he worked
the other children would come and look on. Mr. Alan S. Cole has told
us that once Whistler found his three little daughters decorating the
drawing-room and hanging up a big welcome in flowers for their mother,
who was to return. He forgot what he had come for and helped, as
eager and excited as they, and stayed until Mrs. Cole arrived. He was
walking from the Paris studio one day with Mrs. Clifford Addams and
saw some children playing; he made her stop, "I must look at the
babbies," he said, "you know, I love the babbies!" Later, during
his last illness, he liked to have Mrs. Addams' own little girl, Diane, in
the studio. And there are portraits of Brandon Thomas' baby and
<i>Master Stephen Manuel</i> that show his pleasure in painting his small
sitters. The children of the street adored him; the children of Chelsea
and Fitzroy Street, who were used to artists, knew him well. There was
one he was for ever telling us about, of five or six, who frightened while
she fascinated him. "I likes whusky," she confided one day when she
was posing, "and I likes Scoatch best!" She described her Christmas
at home: "Father 'e was drunk, mother was drunk, sister was drunk,
I was drunk, and we made the cat drunk, too!" A still younger child
gave him sittings, a baby of not more than three, the model for many
of the pastels. She and her mother were resting one afternoon, Whistler
watching her every movement. "Really," he said, "you are a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
little thing!" She looked up at him, "Yes, I is, Whistler," she
lisped. And there is the old story: "Where did you come from, Mr.
Whistler?" "I came from on high, my dear." "H'm, never should
have thought it," said the child; "shows how we can deceive ourselves."
But his popularity with children did not help him one Sunday afternoon,
the only time it is possible to sketch with comfort in the City, when he
went with J. to make a study of Clerkenwell Church tower, which was
about to be restored. They drove to the church, but the light was bad
and the colour not right, so they wandered off to Cloth Fair&mdash;until a
little while ago the most perfect, really the only, bit of old London.
Though Whistler had worked there many times, this afternoon the
children did not approve of him. After a short encounter in which
they, as always, got the better, Whistler and J. retired to another cab,
followed by any refuse that came handy. But the children he painted,
<i>The Little Rose of Lyme Regis</i>, <i>The Little Lady Sophie of Soho</i>, <i>Lillie
in our Alley</i>, the small Italian waifs and strays, were his friends, and no
painter ever gave the grace and feeling of childhood, or of girlhood as
in <i>Miss Woakes</i>, more sympathetically.</p>

<p>He was as absorbed in a series of nudes. Few of his paintings towards
the end satisfied him so entirely as the small <i>Phryne the Superb,
Builder of Temples</i>, which he sent to the International in 1901 and to the
<i>Salon</i> in 1902. The first time he showed it to us he asked:</p>

<p>"Would she be more superb&mdash;more truly the builder of Temples&mdash;had
I painted her what is called life-size by the foolish critics who bring
out their foot-rule? Is it a question of feet and inches when you look
at her?"</p>

<p>He intended to paint an Eve, an Odalisque, a Bathsheba, and a
Danaë, the designs to be enlarged on canvas by his apprentices, Mr. and
Mrs. Clifford Addams, but this was never done. Suggestions were in the
pastels of figures, for which he found the perfect model in London.
When not in the studio, he kept sketching her from memory, and he was
in despair when she married and went to some remote colony, but
before she went he gave her some beautiful silver. These pastels
are many and perfect. They are drawings on brown paper&mdash;studies
or impressions of the model in infinite poses. In some she stands
with her filmy draperies floating about her or falling in long, straight
folds to her feet; in others she lies upon a couch, indolent and lovely;
she dances across the paper, she bends over a great bowl, she sits
with her slim legs crossed and a cup of tea in her hand, she holds a
fan or a flower; but whatever she may be doing or however she may
rest, she is but another expression of the beauty that haunted Whistler,
the beauty that was the inspiration of the <i>Harmonies in White</i> and the
<i>Six Projects</i>. Many poses are suggested in lithographs, etchings, and
water-colours; none show greater tenderness than when she returned
with her child. He put his own tenderness into the encircling hands
of the mother holding the baby on her knee, he found the most rhythmic
lines when, standing, she balanced herself to clasp the child the
more closely to her. Nothing could be slighter than the means by
which the effect is produced, the figures drawn in black upon the
brown paper, the colour&mdash;blue, or rose, or violet&mdash;suggested in the
gauzy draperies or the cap or handkerchief knotted about the curls.
But they have the exquisiteness of Tanagra figures and are as complete.</p>

<p>All this work was done with feverish concern about mediums and
materials and methods He usually sat now as he worked, and he
wore spectacles, sometimes two pairs, one over the other. He was
never so thoughtful in the preparation of his colours and his canvas.
At last the knowledge was coming to him, he said again and again.
And he was never more successful in obtaining the unity and harmony
he had always sought, in hiding the labour by which it was obtained,
and in giving to his painting the beauty of surface he prized so highly.
Because in painting he tried to carry on the same subject, the same
tradition, superficial critics accused him of repeating himself, or mistook
his later for earlier works, like the critic of the <i>Times</i> who, in writing of
his pictures at the International Society's Exhibition of 1898, referred
to "old works ... among which <i>The Little Blue Bonnet</i> is the least
known," a remark Whistler printed in the <i>édition de luxe</i> of the catalogue,
with the explanation that the painting had come "fresh from the
easel to its first exhibition," and that therefore "the 'plain man' is,
once more, profoundly right, and we see again the advantage of memory
over mere artistic instinct in the critic." The small portraits and marines
of the nineties are as fine as anything he ever did. The fact that for all
these pictures he used frames of the same size and the same design
helped&mdash;unintentionally on his part&mdash;to confuse critics accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
to the flamboyant vulgarity, utter inappropriateness, and complete
indifference to scale in the frames of most painters. But then there
are not half a dozen painters in a generation who have the faintest
idea of decoration. Whistler, Puvis de Chavannes, and John La Farge
are almost the only decorators whose names may be mentioned among
moderns. Though some of Whistler's portraits are more elaborate,
not one is more powerful or more masterly as a study of
character, and therefore more individual, than <i>The Master Smith
of Lyme Regis</i>. When it is contrasted with <i>The Little Rose</i>, the
embodiment of simple, sweet, healthy childhood, and <i>The Little Lady
Sophie of Soho</i> and <i>Lillie in our Alley</i>, the sickly atmosphere of the slums
reflected in their strange beauty, and these again with the exuberant
colour and life of <i>Carmen</i>, there can be no question of the variety in
Whistler's later work, though a certain manner, that might have grown
into mannerism, became more marked. There was a similarity in the
general design. Most were heads and half-lengths, and, except in the
finest, nose, eyes, and mouth were alike in character, and hands were
badly drawn and clumsily put in. The colour was beautiful and he
exulted in it, but at the very last he must have known as well as anybody
that his power of work was leaving him.</p>

<p>Whistler spent the summer of 1898 chiefly in London, going first
to Mr. Heinemann's at Whitehall Court, then to Garlant's Hotel. The
delightful evenings of the year before began again for us, and there was
a fresh interest for him in the war between the United States and Spain.
"It was a wonderful and beautiful war," he thought, "the Spaniards
were gentlemen," and his pockets were filled with newspaper clippings
to prove it. If we pointed out a blunder on the part of our soldiers, if
we gave chance a share in our victories, he was furious:</p>

<p>"Why say if any but Spaniards had been at the top of San Juan,
we never would have got there? Why question the <i>if</i>? The facts are
all that count. No fight could be more beautifully managed. I am
telling you! I, a West Point man, know. What if Cervera did get
whipped? What if he was pulled up from the sea looking like a wad
of cotton that had been soaked in an ink-bottle? What of it? Didn't
the whole United States Navy, headed by the admirals, receive him
as the Commander of the Spanish Fleet should be received?"</p>

<p>He was going out more and seeing more people. But his interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
in society was less, and evidently he preferred the quiet of the evenings
with us. Chance encounters in our flat were often an entertainment.
One we recall most vividly was with Frederick Sandys, whom he had not
met for thirty years. Sandys was with us in the late afternoon when
Whistler knocked his exaggerated postman's knock that could not be
mistaken, followed by the resounding peal of the bell. They gave each
other a chilly recognition and sat down. Sandys was agitated, but there
was no escape. Whistler looked like Boldini's portrait, but soon they
began to talk, and they talked till the early hours of the morning as if they
were back at Rossetti's, Sandys in the white waistcoat with gold buttons,
but bent with age, Whistler straight and erect, but wrinkled and grey.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris late in the autumn, settling there for the
winter. Except for his attacks of illness, there was but one interruption
to his work. Mr. Heinemann was married at Porto d'Anzio in February
1899, and Whistler went to Italy as best man. This was his only visit
to Rome. He was disappointed. To us he described the city as "a
bit of an old ruin alongside of a railway station where I saw Mrs. Potter
Palmer." And he added:</p>

<p>"Rome was awful&mdash;a hard sky all the time, a glaring sun and a
strong wind. After I left the railway station, there were big buildings
more like Whiteley's than anything I expected in the Eternal City. St.
Peter's was fine, with its great yellow walls, the interior too big, perhaps,
but you had only got to go inside to know where Wren got his ideas&mdash;how
he, well, you know, robbed Peter's to build Paul's! And I liked
the Vatican, the Swiss Guards, great big fellows, lolling about, as in
Dumas; they made you think of D'Artagnan, Aramis, and the others.
And Michael Angelo? A tremendous fellow, yes; the frescoes in the
Sistine Chapel, interesting as pictures, but with all the legs and arms
of the figures sprawling everywhere, I could not see the decoration.
There can be no decoration without repose; a tremendous fellow, but
not so much in the David and other things I was shown in Rome and
Florence as in that one unfinished picture at the National Gallery.
There is often elegance in the <i>loggie</i> of Raphael, but the big frescoes
of the <i>stanze</i> did not interest me."</p>

<p>Velasquez's portrait of <i>Innocent X.</i> in the Doria Palace he, apparently,
did not see.</p>

<p>During the journey to Porto d'Anzio, Princess &mdash;&mdash;, one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
wedding guests, who heard vaguely that Whistler was an artist, inquired
of him:</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur fait de la peinture, n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, Princesse.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>On me l'avait dit. Moi aussi, j'en fais, Monsieur.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Charmant, Princesse, nous sommes des collègues.</i>"</p>

<p>On the way back from Rome Whistler stopped at Florence, and of
his stay there Mr. J. Kerr-Lawson wrote us the account:</p>

<p>"The McNeill has been here and just gone&mdash;we had him lightly
on our hands all day yesterday.</p>

<p>"We didn't 'do' Florence, for there was a fierce glaring sun and a
horrible <i>Tramontana</i> raging, so we spent the best of the morning
trying to write a letter in the rococo manner to the Syndic of Murano
quite unsuccessfully. [This was after the awards in the Venice International
Exhibition.]</p>

<p>"After luncheon I took him down to the Uffizi. We seemed to be
the only people rash enough to brave the awful wind, for we saw no one
in the Gallery but a frozen <i>Guardia</i>. He&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;was brushed
aside by a magnificent and truly awe-inspiring gesture as we approached
that battered and begrimed portrait in which Velasquez still looks
out upon the world which he has mastered with an expression of
superbly arrogant scorn in the Portrait Gallery.</p>

<p>"It was a dramatic moment&mdash;the flat-brimmed <i>chapeau de haut
forme</i> came off with a grand sweep and was deposited on a stool, and
then the Master, standing back about six feet from the picture and drawing
himself up to much more than his own full natural height, with his
left hand upon his breast and the right thrust out magisterially, exclaimed,
'<i>Quelle allure!</i>' Then you should have seen him. After the
solemn act of homage, when he had resumed his hat, we relaxed considerably
over the lesser immortals of this crazy and incongruous Valhalla&mdash;what
an ill-assorted company! How did they all get together?
Liotard, the Swiss, jostles Michael Angelo, Giuseppe MacPherson rubs
shoulders with Titian, Herkomer hangs beside Ingres, and Poynter is a
pendant to Sir Joshua. There are the greatest and the least, the noblest
and the meanest brought together by the capricious folly of succeeding
directors and harmonised by that touch of vanity that makes the whole
world kin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"One wonders whom they will ask next. Certainly not Whistler.
They knew quite well he was here, but not the slightest notice was taken
of him. <i>En revanche</i>, every now and then some vulgar mediocrity
passes this way, and then the foolish Florentines are lavish with their
laurels."</p>

<p>Whistler had not been long dead when J. received an inspired letter
from Florence asking him if he could obtain Whistler's portrait for the
Uffizi. His answer was that had they appreciated Whistler they might
have asked him while he was alive, but as they had not had the sense
or the courage to do so, they had better apply to his executrix. As
yet there is no portrait of Whistler in the Uffizi.</p>

<p>After absences from his studio Whistler discovered again that
pictures and prints were disappearing. It worried him, and he tried to
trace and recover them. We have little doubt that, at times, Whistler
lost prints through his carelessness. We know that once his method
of drying his etchings between sheets of blotting paper thrown on the
floor was disastrous. One morning an artist came to see us bringing
a number of beautiful proofs of the second Venice Set, in sheets of blotting
paper as he had bought them from an old rag and paper man in
Red Lion Passage, who thought they could be no good because the
margins were cut down and so sold them for a shilling apiece. The
artist admitted that he did not care for them, and we offered him half-a-crown.
"Oh," he said, "as you are willing to give that, now I shall find
out what they are really worth." He got sixty pounds for them, but
several of the prints separately have since sold for much more. Accidents
like this would account for some of the things Whistler thought
were stolen. A few works that had disappeared were recovered during
his lifetime. But shortly after his death there was a sale at the Hôtel
Drouot in which missing paintings, drawings, plates, prints, and even
letters were dispersed. Only those who were near him can realise how
much this troubled and annoyed him during his last years. At the
same time he began to suffer from another of the evils of success. Pictures,
somewhat resembling his and attributed to him appeared at
auctions, and others were sent to him for identification or signature by
persons who had purchased them. If he knew beforehand that one of
these fakes was coming up in the auction-room, he would send and try to
stop the sale, or, if submitted to him, he would not give it back. Neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
expedient met with marked success. At present there is a factory of
Whistlers in full operation, while oils and water-colours and drawings
ascribed to him without the slightest reason have been openly sold
at auction, despite the protests made against such swindles.</p>

<p>Whistler could not stay long from London, and the early summer of
1899 saw him back at Garlant's and visiting Mr. Heinemann at Weybridge.
He was in town for the sequel to the Eden affair. He heard
that, on July 15, there was to be a sale of Sir William Eden's pictures
at Christie's. He went to it and came to us afterwards.</p>

<p>"Really, it has been beautiful. I know you will enjoy it. It
occurred to me in the morning&mdash;the Baronet's sale to-day&mdash;h'm&mdash;the
Butterfly should see how things are going! And I went home,
and I changed my morning dress, my dandy straw hat, and then, very
correct and elegant, I sauntered down King Street into Christie's.
At the top of the stairway someone spoke to me. 'Well, you know,
my dear friend,' I said, 'I do not know who you are, but you shall
have the honour of taking me in.' And on his arm I walked into the big
room. The auctioneer was crying, 'Going! Going! Thirty shillings!
Going!' 'Ha ha!' I laughed&mdash;not loudly, not boisterously, it
was very delicately, very neatly done. But the room was electrified.
Some of the henchmen were there; they grow rigid, afraid to move
afraid to glance my way out of the corners of their eyes. 'Twenty
shillings! Going!' the auctioneer would cry. 'Ha ha!' I would
laugh, and things went for nothing and the henchman trembled. Louis
Fagan came across the room to speak to me&mdash;Fagan, representing the
British Museum, as it were, was quite the most distinguished man
there. And now, having seen how things were, I took Fagan's arm.
'You,' I said, 'may have the honour of taking me out.'"</p>

<p>He dined with us the next evening and found Mr. Harry Wilson,
whose brother-in-law, Mr. Sydney Morse, was the friend upon whose
arm Whistler had entered the auction-room. Mr. Wilson was full
of the story, and confirmed the "electric shock" when Whistler
appeared.</p>

<p>He ran over to Holland once during the summer. Part of the time
he was at Pourville, near Dieppe, where he had taken a house for Miss
Birnie Philip and her mother. The sea was on the right side at Dieppe,
of which he never tired; at Madame Lefèvre's restaurant he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
get as good a breakfast as in Paris; and many small marines, oils, and
water-colours were done before bad weather drove him away.</p>

<p>Though it is not always easy to identify the place or the time to
which his small marines belong, for they cover a number of years,
probably more were made at Dieppe than anywhere else. When he
did not care to work from the shore there were boatmen who would take
him out beyond the breakers, where he could get the effect he wished
at the height above the water that suited him. He used to be seen
calmly painting away in a dancing row-boat, the boatman holding it
as steadily as he could. There is as much of the bigness of the ocean
in these little paintings, which show usually only the grey or blue or
green, but ever recurring, swell of the wave, or a quiet sea with two or
three sails on the horizon, as in any big marines that ever were painted.
He explained his method to his apprentice, Mrs. Addams. When the
wave broke and the surf made a beautiful line of white, he painted this
at once, then all that completed the beauty of the breaking wave, then
the boat passing, and then, having got the movement and the beauty
that goes almost as soon as it comes, he put in the shore or the horizon.</p>

<p>In Paris, during the winter of 1899-1900, he took two small rooms
at the Hôtel Chatham, where the last three years he had often stayed,
afraid to risk the dampness of the Rue du Bac. But they were inner
rooms with no light and scarcely any ventilation, though most swell
and more expensive, unless, perhaps, the lady who used to come to
massage him was included. He had fewer friends in Paris than in
London, and he was often lonely. He would go to see Drouet and say,
"<i>Tu sais, je suis ennuyé.</i>" And Drouet, to amuse him, would get up
little dinners, at which all who were left of the old group of students
met again. One was given in honour of Becquet, whom Whistler had
etched almost half a century before. A wreath of laurels was prepared.
During dinner Drouet said he had met many great men, but, <i>pour la
morale</i>, none greater than Becquet, who was moved to tears, and the
laurel wreath was offered to him by Whistler, and Becquet fairly broke
down; he "would hang it on the walls of his studio, always to have it
before him," he said.</p>

<p>Once Drouet took Whistler to the fair at Neuilly, made him ride
in a merry-go-round. Whistler lost his hat, dropped his eye-glass.
"What would London journalists say if they could see me now?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
he asked. They generally dined at Beaujé's, in the Passage des Panoramas,
to which Drouet and other artists, literary men, and barristers
went. Whistler renewed his intimacy with Oulevey, whom he had
barely seen since the early Paris days. Madame Oulevey's memories
are, above all, of Whistler's dining with them in the Passage des Favorites
at the other end of the Rue Vaugirard, when he wore his pumps and,
a storm coming up and not a cab to be found in their quarter, and they
had to keep him for hours. His pumps left an impression on Drouet,
too, who was sure it was because Whistler wore them by day and could
not walk in them that he was so often seen driving through the streets
in a cab. And he seemed so tired then, Drouet said, half the time lying
back, fast asleep. Fantin, the most intimate of his early associates, he
met but once and then by chance.</p>

<p>In February news came of the death of his brother, Doctor Whistler.
Alexander Harrison writes us:</p>

<p>"I chanced to call upon him half an hour after he had received the
news and, with a quivering voice and tears in his eyes, he told me that he
considered me a friend and told me his sad loss and asked me to dine
with him."</p>

<p>The two brothers had been devoted since boyhood, and Whistler felt
the Doctor's death acutely. It made him the more ready to rejoin
his friends in London, and two months later found him staying with
Mr. Heinemann, who had moved from Whitehall Court to Norfolk
Street.</p>

<p>There E. dined to meet him the evening after his arrival. Mr.
Arthur Symons gives, in his <i>Studies in Seven Arts</i>, his impression of the
dinner, and of Whistler:</p>

<p>"I never saw anyone so feverishly alive as this little old man, with
his bright withered cheeks, over which a skin was drawn tightly, his
darting eyes, under their prickly bushes of eyebrow, his fantastically
creased black and white curls of hair, his bitter and subtle mouth, and,
above all, his exquisite hands, never at rest."</p>

<p>To us the idea of his age was never present. He seemed the
youngest wherever he was. But to those who saw him for the first
time it was evident that he was growing old. And he had been before
the public for so long that people got an exaggerated idea of his age.
Mr. Symons continues:</p>

<p>"Some person officially connected with art was there, an urbane
sentimentalist; and after every official platitude there was a sharp
crackle from Whistler's corner, and it was as if a rattlesnake had leapt
suddenly out."</p>

<p>When the "urbane sentimentalist" remarked that "there never
was such a thing as an art-loving people, an artistic period," Whistler
said: "Dear me! It's very flattering to find that I have made you see
at last. But really, you know, I shall have to copyright my little
things after this!"</p>

<p>When someone objected to the good manners of the French, because
they were all on the surface, Whistler suggested, "Well, you know,
a very good place to have them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII: THE INTERNATIONAL.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-SEVEN TO NINETEEN HUNDRED AND
THREE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> artists should hold Exhibitions of International Art was Whistler's
idea. He had always hoped for a gallery where he could show his
work in his own way with the work of men in sympathy with him.
Often, and years before, he talked to us of this. It mattered little
to him where the gallery should be, in New York or London, Paris
or Berlin: the exhibition should not be local or national, but an
Art Congress for the artists of the world. This was his aim. The
men whom he wished to have associated with him lived mostly in
London, where now the greater part of his time was spent, and
London seemed the place for the first exhibition. He and Mr. E. A.
Walton tried to lease the Grosvenor Gallery, and when they failed
they turned to the Grafton. But again there were difficulties, and
nothing definite was done until 1897, when a young journalist, who
was painting, Mr. Francis Howard, conceived the idea of promoting
a company to hold an exhibition at Prince's Skating Club, Knightsbridge.
As the artists were to incur no financial responsibilities and
to have complete artistic control, Whistler consented to co-operate.
The first meeting, the minutes record, was on December 23, 1897,
and John Lavery, E. A. Walton, G. Sauter, and Francis Howard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
were present. Whistler, who had been consulted, at first agreed that
members of the Royal Academy and other artistic bodies should be
admitted, and at the second meeting, February 7, 1898, Mr. Alfred
Gilbert, R.A., took the chair. A circular, unsigned and undated, was
then issued calling attention to a proposed exhibition of International
Art, and on it appeared the names of James McNeill Whistler, Alfred
Gilbert, Frederick Sandys, John Lavery, James Guthrie, Arthur
Melville, Charles W. Furse, Charles Ricketts, C. Hazlewood Shannon,
E. A. Walton, Joseph Farquharson, Maurice Greiffenhagen, Will
Rothenstein, G. Sauter, Francis Howard. It stated, with a clumsiness
Whistler could hardly have passed had he seen the circular beforehand,
that the object of the Society was the much-needed "organisation in
London of Exhibitions of the finest Art of the time ... the non-recognition
of nationality in Art, and the hanging and placing of
works irrespective of such consideration.... The Exhibitions,
filling as they will an unoccupied place in the cosmopolitan ground
of International Art, will not be in opposition to existing institutions."</p>

<p>An Executive Council appointed itself, and on February 16, 1898,
Whistler was unanimously elected Chairman. The most distinguished
artists of every nationality were invited to join an Honorary Council.
The Executive, to which J., on Whistler's nomination, was elected in
March, was to have entire charge of the affairs of the exhibition. There
were to be no ordinary members, but only honorary members by
invitation.</p>

<p>Jealousies and preferences immediately crept in. Mr. Gilbert
resigned, which was much to be regretted, and several other English
members withdrew from the Council, which speedily became as international
as the name of the society, the International Society of Sculptors,
Painters, and Gravers, into which it formed itself two months later
(April 23), when officers were elected, and Whistler, proposed by
Mr. Lavery and seconded by Mr. J. J. Shannon, was chosen President,
Mr. Lavery Vice-President, and Mr. Francis Howard, Honorary
Secretary.</p>

<p>The International was the second society of artists over which
Whistler presided. Only ten years had passed since his resignation
from the British Artists, but the change in his position before the
world was great. The British Artists, an old and decrepit body, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
chosen him as President in the hope that his "notoriety" and his
following of young men would bring the advertisement they needed;
the International, a young, vigorous organisation, elected him because
they knew that no other artist could give them such distinction and
distinguished foreign artists such assurance that their work would
be hung in a country where previously, through fear of competition
and insular prejudice, it had been rejected. In the eighties Whistler
was mistrusted; in the nineties he was acknowledged as one of the
great artists of the century. The change in his position was not greater
than his influence on contemporary art. This influence had been
pointed out by the few for some years past. But the last decade had
strengthened it until it could no longer be denied. The younger
generation had accepted him in the meanwhile, admitted their debt
to him, and proclaimed it openly in their work. The New English
Art Club abjured subject and sentiment for the "painter's poetry"
wherever it might lurk, whether in the London bus transformed by
the London atmosphere, or in the <i>Lion-Comique</i>, transfigured on the
music-hall stage; though, as Whistler once said, the New English
Art Club was "only a raft," while the International was to be a "battleship"
of which he would take command. The Glasgow School accepted
his teaching and then copied his technique, in some cases pushing
imitation to folly. But still, all that was healthiest and best in the
art of the country came from these two groups, and members of both
had made an international reputation before the International was
founded. Even in the Academy anecdote had lost for an interval
its pre-eminence, and it looked as if Academicians might begin to understand
that the painter's sole object need not be to tell a story. Besides,
there were two artists, R. A. M. Stevenson and J., writing upon art,
and they taught young men to have faith in Whistler, and the "new
criticism was born," and D. S. MacColl was the name of the first and
only child.</p>

<p>Nor was Whistler's influence confined to England. From the
early eighties, when the jury was becoming more representative at
the old <i>Salon</i>, the pictures he sent to it had been hung. From the
early nineties the new <i>Salon</i> gave them prominence. Other recent
influences in France had waxed and waned. The realism of Bastien-Lepage,
which sank into photography with painters of less accomplishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
and the square brush-mark were already <i>vieux jeu</i>.
Impressionism had swamped itself in chemical problems, and the technique
of the Impressionists had been degraded to the exaggerations
and absurdities of the <i>Rose-Croix</i>, to be swamped in turn by the latest
fad of all. Whistler brought with him technical sanity, a feeling
for beauty and reverence for tradition, and he, who had been called
the most eccentric of <i>poseurs</i> in paint, led the way back to dignity and
reticence in art, from which he had never swerved. His example
was revealed in the work of artists of every nationality, either by frank
imitation or else by their attitude towards Nature or the reserve of
their technique. Because of this universal recognition, he was best
qualified for the Presidency of an International Society of Artists.</p>

<p>The honour was paid him by no official body. Officially, to the
last, he was destined to go without due recognition. In France he
was an ordinary <i>Sociétaire</i> of the <i>Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts</i>.
The National Academy of Design in America was as indifferent to
him as the Royal Academy in England. His membership in the
Academies of Dresden, Munich, Rome, and Scotland was a compliment&mdash;a
compliment he could and did appreciate&mdash;but it carried
no responsibilities and required no active work, and almost all these
honours came after the International was started. But the new society,
if not official, included on its executive the strongest outsiders in Great
Britain, and had the support of the most distinguished men of his
profession throughout the world. Their choice of him was an acknowledgment
of his supremacy as artist and an expression of confidence
in him as leader, and he took no less pleasure in their tribute than
trouble not to disappoint their expectations. His experience with
the British Artists was a help in constituting the Society. The sole
authority rested with the Executive Council, the members of which
elected themselves and could not be got rid of except by their voluntary
resignation or expulsion. Theoretically the idea was magnificent, if
the narrowest and most autocratic. "Napoleon and I do these things,"
Whistler said, and Suffolk Street had taught him that an intelligent
autocrat is the best leader possible. His policy, if autocratic, was
broad. In most societies painting held a monopoly, but, in his,
sculpture and "graving" should have equal importance. All his
rules were far-seeing and practical, and the decline of the Society
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
since his death is due to the disregard of them: a disregard which
his associates still on the Council who are true to his memory cannot
prevent&mdash;or forget.</p>

<p>The first exhibition was opened in May 1898. The Skating Rink
at Knightsbridge was divided into three large and two small galleries.
Whistler's scheme of decoration was adopted, and the hanging was
more perfect than any up to that time even on the Continent. The
President's velarium, without question of patent, was used, and he
designed the seal for the Society and the cover of the catalogue. The
artistic success of the show could not be questioned. No such collection
of modern art had been seen in London, a proof that Whistler was as
broad as the painters and the populace were sure he was narrow. The
"Why drag in Velasquez?" story is often quoted by the ignorant
and the foolish and the stupid. In this Exhibition he dragged in everyone
of eminence, for, though the ignorant and the foolish and the
stupid may never understand, the "Why drag in Velasquez?" was
uttered only for their benefit. Whistler showed a group of early
pictures: <i>At the Piano</i>, <i>La Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine</i>, <i>Rosa
Corder</i>, with later works: <i>The Philosopher</i>, <i>The Little Blue Bonnet</i>,
his own half-length portrait in a white jacket, <i>Brown and Gold</i>. The
sculpture was as interesting as the painting. There were drawings and
engravings. Besides, his idea was to have special exhibitions, and
Aubrey Beardsley, who had just died, was honoured. Before the show
was over delegates were sent, and communications received, from Paris
and Venice asking for an exchange of exhibitions.</p>

<p>Whistler came from Paris for the opening, a quiet affair as the
endeavour to obtain the presence of the Prince of Wales failed, and he
lunched with the Council on the opening day and attended one or two
Sunday afternoon receptions. He agreed that a fine illustrated catalogue
should be published by Mr. Heinemann, with <i>The Little Blue
Bonnet</i>, in photogravure, as frontispiece. If the first exhibition was a
complete artistic success it proved a complete financial failure. But
luckily the Society had no pecuniary responsibility.</p>

<p>Whistler knew it is impossible for a man to serve actively in two
rival societies; he had said so to the British Artists; and he determined
that members of the Council of the International who were
members of other societies must leave the Society, or, if not, he would.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
His decision was precipitated by a new election to the Council. He
was in Paris, and the fact that two members of the Council, Lavery and
J., left London at an hour's notice for the Rue du Bac to arrange matters
with him shows how anxious he was for the welfare of his Society.
They arrived early in the morning. Whistler was not up, but sent
word that they must breakfast with him in the studio. During breakfast
he talked of everything but the Society; after breakfast he made
them listen to a Fourth of July spread-eagle oration squeaked out
of a primitive gramophone that somebody had given him and that he
loved; and it was not until twenty minutes before they had to start
back that he referred to the Council. Then he had all his plans ready,
and he stated what he proposed to do, and what he wanted done, what
must be done&mdash;we might add, what was done. And not only at every
crisis, but in every detail, he directed the management of the Society,
and he demanded that every report, every project should be submitted
to him. He expected the deference due to him as President, and in
return he gave his unswerving support. Even during his last illness
nothing was done without his knowledge and approval.</p>

<p>The second International Exhibition, or "Art Congress," was held
at Knightsbridge from May to July 1899. The President came over
when the hanging was finished. It was arranged this year that a special
show of his etchings should be made, and a small room was decorated
and called the White Room. As Whistler was in Paris, he asked J.
and Mrs. Whibley to go to the studio and select the prints. J. chose
a number that had not been seen before, principally from the <i>Naval
Review Series</i>. Whistler, for some reason, resented the selection when
he saw the prints on the walls. The Committee were in consternation
and sent for J. Whistler said to him:</p>

<p>"Now look what you have done!"</p>

<p>"But what have I done? Have I done you any harm?"</p>

<p>And that was the end of it. His objection may have been because
he feared, as we remember his saying of these prints another time,
that they were "beyond the understanding of the abomination outside."
But his fury lasted only for the moment, and he and Lavery and J.
passed a good part of the night at work in the gallery on the catalogue.</p>

<p>Whistler received on the opening day, and in the evening the first
of the Round Table Council dinners was held at the Café Royal, Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
James Guthrie presiding. In an admirable speech he expressed not
only the delight of the Council at being able to enlist the sympathy
and aid of Whistler, but their love and appreciation for the man and
his work. The sympathy then existing between the President and
most of the Council was genuine, and he appreciated it as much as
they did. After dinner a few of the Council went with him to Sir John
Lavery's, where he was staying, and there he read <i>The Baronet and the
Butterfly</i>, which had just appeared in Paris. This, because of absence
or ill-health, was the only Council dinner he went to, though for a time
there was one every year, and at several Rodin presided.</p>

<p>To the second exhibition the President sent several small canvases
recently finished. Again the infallible critics discussed them as promising
works of the past, and were made to eat their words, and again
in the catalogue Whistler quoted the <i>Times</i>, and to its opinion of to-day
of "... the vanished hand which drew the <i>Symphony in White</i> and
<i>Miss Alexander</i>" compared its opinion "of the moment" of those
two pictures, when the <i>Miss Alexander</i> suggested a sketch left "before
the colours were dry in a room where the chimney-sweeps were at
work," and was "uncompromisingly vulgar." "Other Times, other
lines!" was Whistler's comment. Three illustrated catalogues were
published by Messrs. W. H. Ward and Company. Whistler's <i>Chelsea
Rags</i> and <i>Trouville</i> were both included in the ordinary editions, and
the <i>Little Lady Sophie of Soho</i> and <i>Lillie in our Alley</i> were added to
the <i>édition de luxe</i>. The catalogues until 1910, when even Whistler's
<i>format</i> was discarded, are the most interesting issued by any society.
The second exhibition was less of a success financially than the first,
and the Society of Artists came near being involved in the crash which
overtook the financing company. To avoid complications Whistler
insisted that the Society should have an Honorary Solicitor and
Treasurer, and Mr. William Webb was appointed.</p>

<p>In the first and second exhibitions the art of the world was represented
as it never had been before in England,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as it never has been
since. In both, attempts to attract the public with music and receptions
and entertainments were made, but Whistler objected to music,
saying that the two arts should be kept separate, that people who came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
to hear the music could not see the pictures, and people who came to
see the pictures would not want to hear the music. There were
misunderstandings with the proprietor and the promoters, the former
wishing to see some of his friends represented, and the latter to see
some of their money back, and the outlook was gloomy. Whistler
wrote a memorable letter in which he said that he, as commander,
proposed to repel pirates and sink their craft, and they never openly
got aboard, though a few stowaways did creep in.</p>

<p>No show was held in 1900, the Paris Universal Exhibition taking
up the members' energy, and not until the autumn of 1901 was the third
exhibition opened at the Galleries of the Royal Institute in Piccadilly.
There had been official and other changes. Professor Sauter had been
made Honorary Secretary, <i>pro tem.</i>, and the Society, which up till
now had consisted of the Council only, admitted Associates, and with
their election the international character began to wane, for, out of
thirty-two Associates elected, twenty-eight were resident in Great
Britain. This exhibition was the first to be financially successful.
The President sent seven small paintings and pastels. <i>Phryne the
Superb</i> was reproduced in the catalogue, as well as <i>Gold and Orange&mdash;The
Neighbours</i>, and <i>Green and Silver&mdash;The Great Sea</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Sauter devoted himself to furthering the International
idea of the President, and under his Secretaryship the Society held
exhibitions of its English members' work in Budapest, Munich, and
afterwards in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and St. Louis. On
June 11, 1903, Professor Sauter was relieved temporarily of the Secretaryship
and J. took his place. Within a few weeks it was his sad duty
to call a meeting to announce to the Society the loss they had sustained
by the death of their President.</p>

<p>The Council determined to follow the traditions of Whistler and
to honour his memory. Not only were the American exhibitions
held, but the Society organised a show of British art in Dusseldorf,
and made arrangements for a Memorial Exhibition of the President's
works in London. In the autumn of 1903 M. Rodin accepted the
Presidency, and the fourth exhibition, the first held in the New
Gallery, was opened in January 1904, in which the late President
was represented by the <i>Symphony in White, No. III.</i>, lent by Mr.
Edmund Davis; <i>Rose and Gold&mdash;The Tulip</i>, lent by Miss Birnie
Philip; <i>Valparaiso</i>, lent by Mr. Graham Robertson; <i>Symphony in
Grey&mdash;Battersea</i>, lent by Mrs. Armitage; and <i>Study for a Fan</i>, lent
by Mr. C. H. Shannon.</p>

<p>In 1905 the most important and successful show in the career of
the International Society of Sculptors, Painters, and Gravers was
given; the Memorial Exhibition of the works of James McNeill
Whistler. For complete success it lacked only the co-operation of
Whistler's executrix, which the Council originally understood was
promised, but which was ultimately withheld. Still, it was the most
complete exhibition of his works ever given, superior from every point
of view to the small show at the Scottish Academy the previous year,
in many respects to the Boston show of the same year, and to the Paris
Memorial Exhibition, 1905, which was disappointing. As can be seen
from the elaborate catalogue, more especially the beautifully illustrated
<i>édition de luxe</i> published by Mr. Heinemann, the exhibition
at the New Gallery contained nearly all the principal oil-paintings, the
largest collection of etchings ever shown together, all but one or two of
the lithographs, and many of the pastels, water-colours, and drawings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV: THE ACADÉMIE CARMEN.<br />THE YEARS
EIGHTEEN NINETY-EIGHT TO NINETEEN HUNDRED
AND ONE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the autumn of 1898 a circular issued in Paris created a sensation
in the studios. Whistler was going to open a school, the <i>Académie
Whistler</i>. The announcement was made by his model, Madame
Carmen Rossi. Whistler at once wrote from Whitehall Court, where
he was staying (October 1, 1898), to the papers "to correct an erroneous
statement, or rather to modify an exaggeration, that an otherwise
<i>bona fide</i> prospectus is circulating in Paris. An <i>atelier</i> is to be opened
in the Passage Stanislas, and, in company with my friend, the distinguished
sculptor, Mr. MacMonnies, I have promised to attend its
classes. The <i>patronne</i> has issued a document in which this new Arcadia
is described as the <i>Académie Whistler</i> and further qualified as the Anglo-American
School. I would like it to be understood that, having
hitherto abstained from all plot of instruction, this is no sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
assertion in the <i>Ville Lumière</i> of my own. Nor could I be in any way
responsible for the proposed mysterious irruption in Paris of whatever
Anglo-American portends. 'American,' I take it, is synonymous with
modesty, and 'Anglo,' in art, I am unable to grasp at all, otherwise than
as suggestive of complete innocence and the blank of Burlington House.
I purpose only, then, to visit, as harmlessly as may be, in turn with
Mr. MacMonnies, the new academy which has my best wishes, and, if
no other good come of it, at least to rigorously carry out my promise of
never appearing anywhere else."</p>

<p>Whistler had nothing to do with the financial management, everything
with the system of teaching, and he said that he proposed to offer
the students his knowledge of a lifetime. It may be, as we have heard,
that he had been asked, with MacMonnies, to criticise the work of Ary
Renan's or Luc-Olivier Merson's students, and that this gave him the
idea of visiting a school under his own direction.</p>

<p>The Passage Stanislas is a small street running off the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs;
No. 6, a house of two storeys and a courtyard
or garden at the back which was afterwards covered with glass.
Over the front door the sign <i>Académie Whistler</i> did appear, but only
for a short time. The glazed courtyard became a studio, and there
was another above to which a fine old staircase led. The house had
been built, or adapted, as a studio, and, except that the walls were
distempered, no change was made. The rooms were fitted up with
school furniture; for this, we believe, Whistler advanced the money.
Within a few days a vast number of pupils had put their names down,
deserting the other <i>ateliers</i> of Paris. Some left the English schools, and
still others came from Germany and America. Whistler was delighted,
telling us that students were coming in squads, that the Passage was
crowded, and that owners of carriages struggled with <i>rapins</i> and prize-winners
to get in.</p>

<p>Miss Inez Bate (Mrs. Clifford Addams), who was among the earliest
to put down her name, who remained in the school till the end and who
became Whistler's apprentice, has not only told us the story of the
<i>Académie Carmen</i>, but has given us her record of it and of Whistler's
methods of teaching, written at his request and partially corrected by
him. It is the record of his "knowledge of a lifetime," for he taught
in the school the truths he had been years formulating, and is of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
greatest importance, as valuable a document as the treatise of Cennino
Cennini. In the future Mrs. Addams' statement, revised by Whistler,
will live.</p>

<p>He insisted on seriousness. The <i>Académie Carmen</i> was not to be like
other schools; instead of singing, there was to be no talking; smoking
was not allowed; the walls were not to be decorated with charcoal;
studio cackle was forbidden; if people wanted these things, they could
go back from whence they came. He was to be received as a master
visiting his pupils, not as a good fellow in his shirt-sleeves. For the first
weeks things did not go very well. Carmen was not used to her post,
the students were not used to such a master, and Whistler was not used
to them. A <i>massier</i> was appointed, and the men and women who had
been working together were separated and two classes formed. Within
a short time Mrs. Addams was chosen <i>massière</i>, a position she held until
the school closed. She writes:</p>

<p>"The <i>Académie</i> began its somewhat disturbed career in the fall
of 1898. A letter was received from Mr. Whistler announcing that
he would shortly appear, and, on the day appointed, the <i>Académie
Carmen</i> had the honour of receiving him for the first time. He proceeded
to look at the various studies, most carefully noting under whose
teaching and in what school each student's former studies had been
pursued.</p>

<p>"Most kindly something was said to each, and to one student who
offered apology for his drawing, Mr. Whistler said simply, 'It is unnecessary&mdash;I
really come to learn&mdash;feeling you are all much cleverer
than I.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler, before he left, expressed to the <i>Patronne</i> his wish
that there should be separate <i>ateliers</i> for the ladies and gentlemen and
that the present habit of both working together should be immediately
discontinued.</p>

<p>"His second visit was spent in consideration of the more advanced
students. One, whose study suffered from the introduction of an
unbeautiful object in the background, because it happened to be there,
was told that, 'One's study, even the most unpretentious, is always
one's picture, and must be, in form and arrangement, a perfect harmony
from the beginning.' With this unheard-of advice, Mr. Whistler
turned to the students, whose work he had been inspecting and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
intimated that they might begin to paint, and so really learn to draw,
telling them that the true understanding of drawing the figure comes by
having learned to appreciate the subtle modellings by the use of the
infinite gradation that paint makes possible.</p>

<p>"On his third visit he turned to one student and picked up her
palette, pointing out that being the instrument on which the painter
plays his harmony, it must be beautiful always, as the tenderly-cared-for
violin of the great musician.</p>

<p>"He suggested that it would be a pleasure to show them his way
of painting, and if this student could, without too much difficulty,
clean her palette, he would endeavour to show them 'the easiest way
of getting into difficulties.'</p>

<p>"And it was then that Mr. Whistler's palette was given. His
whole system lies in the complete mastery of the palette&mdash;on the palette
the work must be done before transferring one note on to the canvas.</p>

<p>"He recommended the small oval palettes as being easy to hold.
White was placed at the top edge in the centre, in generous quantity,
and to the left came in succession yellow ochre, raw sienna, burnt
sienna, raw umber, cobalt, and mineral blue; while to right, vermilion,
Venetian red, Indian red, and black. Sometimes the burnt sienna would
be placed between the Venetian and Indian red, but generally the
former placing of colours was insisted upon.</p>

<p>"A mass of colour, giving the fairest tone of the flesh, would then
be mixed and laid in the centre of the palette near the top, and a
broad band of black curving downward from this mass of light flesh-note
to the bottom, gave the greatest depth possible in any shadow,
and so, between the prepared light and the black, the colour was spread,
and mingled with any of the various pure colours necessary to obtain
the desired changes of note, until there appeared on the palette a tone-picture
of the figure that was to be painted, and at the same time a
preparation for the background was made on the left in equally careful
manner.</p>

<p>"Many brushes were used, each one containing a full quantity of
every dominant note, so that when the palette presented as near a
reproduction of the model and background as the worker could obtain,
the colour could be put down with a generous flowing brush.</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler said, 'I do not interfere with your individuality. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
place in your hands a sure means of expressing it, if you can learn
to understand, and if you have your own sight still.' Each student
prepared his or her palette, in some the mass of light would exceed the
dark, in others the reverse would be the case. Mr. Whistler made no
comments on these conditions of the students' palettes: 'I do not teach
art; I teach the scientific application of paint and brushes.' His one
insistence was that no painting on the canvas should be begun until
the student felt he could go no further on the palette; the various
and harmonious notes were to represent, as nearly as he could see, the
model and background that he was to paint.</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler would often refrain from looking at the students'
canvas, but would carefully examine the palette, saying that there
he could see the progress being made, and that it was really much more
important for it to present a beautiful appearance, than for the canvas
to be fine and the palette inharmonious. He said, 'If you cannot
manage your palette, how are you going to manage your canvas?'</p>

<p>"These statements sounded like heresy to the majority of the
students, and they refused to believe the reason and purpose of such
teaching, and as they had never before received even a hint to consider
the palette of primary importance, they insisted in believing that this
was but a peculiarity of Mr. Whistler's manner of working, and that,
to adopt it, would be with fatal results!</p>

<p>"The careful attempts to follow the subtle modellings of flesh
placed in a quiet, simple light, and therefore extremely grey and intricate
in its change of form, brought about necessarily, in the commencement
of each student's endeavour, a rather low-toned result. One
student said to Mr. Whistler that she did not wish to paint in such low
tones, but wanted to keep her colour pure and brilliant; he answered,
'then keep it in the tubes, it is your only chance at first.'</p>

<p>"They were taught to look upon the model as a sculptor would,
using the paint as a modeller does his clay; to create on the canvas a
statue, using the brush as a sculptor his chisel, following carefully each
change of note, which means 'form'; it being preferable that the
figure should be presented in a simple manner, without an attempt to
obtain a thousand changes of colour that are there in reality, and make
it, first of all, <i>really and truly exist in its proper atmosphere</i>, than that
it should present a brightly coloured image, pleasing to the eye, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
without solidity and non-existent on any real plane. This, it will be
seen, was the reason of Mr. Whistler's repeated and insistent commands
to give the background the most complete attention, believing that by
it alone the figure had a reason to exist.</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler would often paint for the students.</p>

<p>"Once he modelled a figure, standing in the full, clear light of the
<i>atelier</i>, against a dull, rose-coloured wall. After spending almost an
hour upon the palette, he put down with swift, sure touches, the notes
of which his brushes were already generously filled, so subtle that those
standing close to the canvas saw apparently no difference in each
successive note as it was put down, but those standing at the proper
distance away noticed the general turn of the body appear, and the
faint subtle modellings take their place, and finally, when the last delicate
touch of light was laid on, the figure was seen to exist in its proper
atmosphere and at its proper distance within the canvas, modelled,
as Mr. Whistler said, 'in painter's clay,' and ready to be taken up the
next day and carried yet further in delicacy, and the next day further
still, and so on until the end.</p>

<p>"And he insisted that it was as important to train the eye as the
hand, that long accustoming oneself to seeing crude notes in Nature,
spots of red, blue, and yellow in flesh where they are not, had harmed
the eye, and the training to readjust the real, quiet, subtle note of
Nature required long and patient study. 'To find the true note is
the difficulty; it is comparatively easy to employ it when found.'</p>

<p>"He once said that had he been given at the commencement of
his artistic career what he was then offering, his work would have been
different. But he found in his youth no absolute definite facts, and he
'fell in a pit and floundered,' and from this he desired to save whom he
could. 'All is so simple,' he would say, 'it is based on proved scientific
facts; follow this teaching and you <i>must</i> learn to paint; not necessarily
learn art, but, at least, absolutely learn to paint what you see.'</p>

<p>"He also demanded the student to abandon all former methods
of teaching, unless in harmony with his own, and to approach the
science as taught by himself in a simple and trustful manner.</p>

<p>"The students, used to having any little sketch praised, and finding
such efforts remained unnoticed by Mr. Whistler, while an intelligent
and careful, though to their eyes stupid, attempt to model in simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
form and colour would receive approbation, grew irritated, and the
majority left for a more congenial atmosphere.</p>

<p>"It was pointed out that a child, in the simple innocence of infancy,
painting the red coat of the toy soldier red indeed, is in reality nearer
the great truth than the most accomplished trickster with his clever
brushwork and brilliant manipulation of many colours.</p>

<p>"'Distrust everything you have done without understanding it.
It is not sufficient to achieve a fine piece of painting. You must know
<i>how</i> you did it, that the next time you can do it again, and never have
to suffer from that disastrous state of the clever artist, whose friends
say to him, what a charming piece of painting, do not touch it again,
and, although he knows it is incomplete, yet he dare not but comply,
<i>because he knows he might never get the same clever effect again</i>.</p>

<p>"'Remember which of the colours you most employed, how you
managed the turning of the shadow into the light, and if you do not
remember scrape out your work and do it all over again, for one <i>fact</i> is
worth a thousand misty imaginings. You must be able to do every
part equally well, for the greatness of a work of art lies in the perfect
harmony of the whole, not in the fine painting of one or more details.'</p>

<p>"It was many months before a student produced a canvas which
showed a grasp of the science he had so patiently been explaining. Mr.
Whistler delighted in this, and had the canvas placed on an easel and
in a frame that he might more clearly point out to the other students
the reason of its merit; it showed primarily an understanding of the
two great principles; first, it represented a figure <i>inside</i> the frame
and surrounded by the atmosphere of the studio, and secondly, it was
created of one piece of flesh, simply but firmly painted and free from
mark of brush. As the weeks went on, and the progress in this student's
work continued, Mr. Whistler finally handed over to her [Mrs. Addams]
the surveillance of the new-comers and the task of explaining to them
the first principles of his manner.</p>

<p>"The <i>Académie</i> had the distinction of causing the rumour that
something was being taught there, something definite and absolute.</p>

<p>"A large number of students who had been in the <i>Académie</i> for a
short time and left, returned, dissatisfied with other schools, that they
might once more satisfy themselves that nothing was to be learned
there after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler allowed this to continue for some time, but finally,
the fatigue of such constant changes caused him to issue an order that
the <i>Académie Carmen</i> should be tried but once.</p>

<p>"The students in the men's life-class were constantly changing.
On Christmas Day, Mr. Whistler invited them to visit him in his
<i>atelier</i> and showed them many of his own canvases in various stages of
completeness; explaining how certain results had been obtained, and
how certain notes had been blended, and assuring them that he used
the science he was teaching them, only that each student would arrange
it according to his own needs as time went on, begging them not to
hesitate to ask him any question that they wished, or to point out
anything they failed to understand. There was an increased enthusiasm
for a few weeks, but gradually the old spirit of misunderstanding
and mistrust returned, and the men's class again contained but few
students.</p>

<p>"Another disappointment to them was that Mr. Whistler explained
when they showed him pictures they had painted with a hope to exploit
as pupils of the Master in the yearly <i>Salon</i>, that this was impossible,
that their complete understanding of the Great Principles and the
fitting execution of their application could not be a matter of a few
months' study, and he told them he was like a chemist who put drugs
into bottles, and he certainly should not send those bottles out in his
name unless he was quite satisfied with, and sure of, the contents.</p>

<p>"The last week of the first year arrived, and Mr. Whistler spent
the whole of each morning at the <i>Académie</i>. The supervision of one
student's work was so satisfactory that he communicated with her,
after the closing of the <i>Académie</i>, to announce that he desired to enter
into an apprenticeship with her, for a term of five years, as he considered
it would take fully that time to teach her the whole of his
Science and make of her a finished craftsman; with her artistic development
he never for a moment pretended to interfere&mdash;'that,' he said,
'is or is not superb&mdash;it was determined at birth, but I can teach you
<i>how to paint</i>.'</p>

<p>"So, on the 20th of July (1899), the Deed of Apprenticeship [with
Mrs. Addams] was signed and legally witnessed, and she 'bound herself
to her Master to learn the Art and Craft of a painter, faithfully to serve
after the manner of an Apprentice for the full term of five years, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
secrets keep and his lawful commands obey, she shall do no damage to
his goods nor suffer it to be done by others, nor waste his goods, nor
lend them unlawfully, nor do any act whereby he might sustain loss,
nor sell to other painters nor exhibit during her apprenticeship nor
absent herself from her said Master's service unlawfully, but in all
things as a faithful Apprentice shall behave herself towards her said
Master and others during the said term.... And the said Master,
on his side, undertakes to teach and instruct her, or cause her to be
taught and instructed. But if she commit any breach of these covenants
he may immediately discharge her.'</p>

<p>"Into the hands of his Apprentice&mdash;also now the <i>massière</i>&mdash;Mr.
Whistler gave the opening of the school the second year, sending all
instructions to her from Pourville, where he was staying.</p>

<p>"Each new candidate for admission should submit an example of
his or her work to the <i>massière</i>, and so prevent the introduction into
the <i>Académie</i> of, first, those who were at present incompetent to place
a figure in fair drawing upon the canvas; and secondly, those whose
instruction in an adverse manner of painting had gone so far that their
work would cause dissension and argument in the <i>Académie</i>. Unfortunately,
this order was not well received by some, though the majority
were willing to accede to any desire on the part of Mr. Whistler.</p>

<p>"A number absolutely refused to suffer any rule, and preferred
to distrust what they could not understand, and the talk among the
students of the <i>Quartier</i> was now in disparagement of the <i>Académie</i>.</p>

<p>"Compositions were never done in the school. It was so much
more important to learn to paint and draw, for, as Mr. Whistler said, 'if
ever you saw anything really perfectly beautiful, suppose you could not
draw and paint!'&mdash;'The faculty for compositions is part of the artist,
he has it, or he has it not&mdash;he cannot acquire it by study&mdash;he will only
learn to adjust the composition of others, and, at the same time, he
uses his faculty in every figure he draws, every line he makes, while
in the large sense, composition may be dormant from childhood until
maturity, and there it will be found in all its fresh vigour, waiting for
the craftsman to use the mysterious quality in his adjustment of his
perfect drawings to fit their spaces.'</p>

<p>"The third and last year (1900) of the <i>Académie Carmen</i> was marked
at its commencement by the failure to open a men's life-class. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Whistler had suffered so greatly during the preceding years from their
inability to comprehend his principles and also from the short time the
students remained in the school, that at the latter part of the season
he often refused to criticise in the men's class at all. He would call
sometimes on Sunday mornings and take out and place upon easels
the various studies that had been done by the men the previous week,
and often he would declare that nothing interested him among them
and that he should not criticise that week, that he could not face the
fatigue of the 'blankness' of the <i>atelier</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>Académie</i> was opened in October 1900 by a woman's life-class
which was well attended. The school had been moved to an old
building in the Boulevard Montparnasse, but shortly after Mr. Whistler
was taken very ill and he was forced to leave England on a long voyage.
He wrote a letter to the students that never reached them, then, from
Corsica, another, with his best wishes for the New Century, and his
explanation of the doctor's abrupt orders. The <i>Académie</i> was kept
open by the Apprentice until the end of March (1901), but the faith
of the students seemed unable to bear further trials, and after great
discontent at Mr. Whistler's continued absence and a gradual dwindling
away of the students until there were but one or two left, the Apprentice
wrote of this to Mr. Whistler."</p>

<p>Whistler wrote from Ajaccio a formal letter of dismissal to the few
students left, kissing the tips of their rosy fingers, bidding them Godspeed
and stating the case that history might be made. The reading
of the letter by the <i>massière</i> in the <i>atelier</i> closed the school, and an
experiment to which Whistler brought enthusiasm, only to meet from
the average student the distrust the average artist had shown him all
his life. One of the last things he did before the close was to make
an apprentice also of Mr. Clifford Addams, the one man who remained
faithful. And in his case, too, a Deed of Apprenticeship was drawn up
and signed.</p>

<p>The story of the <i>Académie</i> is carried on in the following letter from
Mr. Frederick MacMonnies, concerning his connection with it:</p>

<p>"... I had always heard so much about his being impossible, but
the more I saw of him the more I realised that anyone who could quarrel
with him must be written down an ass.</p>

<p>"An instance of his rare straightforwardness and frankness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
friendship occurred in the Carmen School. He used to come up to
my studio just before breakfast, and we would go off to Lavenue's or
the Café du Cardinal.</p>

<p>"One morning he said he had a great affair on hand. Carmen was
going to open the school and he had agreed to teach, a thing he had
always said was shocking, useless, and encouragement of incapables.
He suggested I help him out with teaching the sculptor pupils and the
drawing, so I gladly agreed.</p>

<p>"All the schools in Paris were deserted immediately, and the funny
little studios of Carmen's place were packed with all kinds of boys and
girls, mostly Americans, who had tried all styles of teaching.</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler, having a full sense of a picturesque <i>grande entrée</i>,
did not appear until the school was in full swing about a week after the
opening, and until the pupils had passed the palpitating stage and were
in a dazed state of expectancy and half collapsed into nervous prostration.
The various samples of such awaiting him represented the
methods of almost every teacher in Paris.</p>

<p>"He arrived, gloves and cane in hand, and enjoyed every minute
of his stay, daintily and gaily touching very weighty matters. A few
days after his arrival I went to the school and found the entire crew
painting as black as a hat&mdash;delicate, rose-coloured pearly models
translated into mulattoes, a most astonishing transformation. As time
went on the blackness increased. Finally, one day, I suggested to one
of the young women who was particularly dreary, to tone her study up.
She informed me she saw it so. I took her palette and keyed the figure
into something like the delicate and brilliant colouring, much to her
disgust. When I had finished, she informed me, 'Mr. Whistler told
me to paint it that way.' I told her she had misunderstood, that he
had never meant her to paint untrue. Several criticisms among the
men of the same sort of thing, and I left.</p>

<p>"Of course, all this was carried to Whistler, and a few days later
after breakfast, over his coffee, he waved his cigarette towards me and
said, 'Now, my dear MacMonnies, I like you&mdash;and I am going to talk to
you the way your mother does (he used to play whist in Paris with my
mother, and they made a most amusing combination). Now, you see,
I have always believed there has been something radically wrong with
all this teaching that has been going on in Paris all these years in Julian's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
and the rest. I decided years ago the principle was false. They give
the young things men's food when they require pap. My idea is to
give them three or four colours&mdash;let them learn to model and paint
the form and line first until they are strong enough to use others. If
they become so, well and good; if not, let them sink out of sight.' I
suggested the doubt that their eyes might in this way be trained to
see wrong. No, he did not agree with that. Anyway, I apologised,
and said I was a presuming and meddlesome ass, and if I had known he
was running his school on a system, I would have remained silent. If
you could have seen the charming manner, the frank kindness and
friendly spirit with which he undertook to remonstrate, you would
understand how much I admired his generous spirit.</p>

<p>"Few men under the circumstances (I being very much his junior)
would not have made a great row and got upon their high horses, and
we would have quit enemies.</p>

<p>"Later, I found that the sculptor pupils did not arrive in droves
to be taught by me, and the drawing criticisms unnecessary, as the
school had become a tonal modelling school and my criticisms superfluous.
I proposed to Mr. Whistler that I was <i>de trop</i>, and that it
could only be properly done by him. He agreed and I left.</p>

<p>"M. Rodin (or his friends) wished to take my place, but Mr.
Whistler, I heard, said he could not under any circumstances have anyone
replace MacMonnies, as it might occasion comment unfavourable to
me. Now I consider that one of the rarest of friendly actions, as I
knew he would not have objected to Rodin otherwise.</p>

<p>"A canny, croaking friend of mine, who hated Whistler and never
lost an opportunity of misquoting and belittling him, dropped in at
my house a few nights after my resignation from the school, quite
full up with croaks of delight that we had fallen out, as he supposed,
and that the row he had long predicted had finally come.
I laughed it off, and after dinner a familiar knock, and who should
be ushered in but Mr. Whistler, asking my mother to play another
game of whist.</p>

<p>"A rather amusing thing occurred in my studio.</p>

<p>"A rich and spread-eagle young American got into a tussle of wits
with Whistler&mdash;neither had met before (Whistler, however, knew and
liked his brother)&mdash;on the advantage of foreign study and life abroad.</p>

<p>I cannot remember all the distinguished and amusing arguments or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
delightful appreciation of the French people of Whistler, or of the
rather boring and rather brutal jabbing of the young man. At any
rate, Whistler defended himself admirably, always keeping his temper,
which the young man wished him to lose in order to trip him up. I saw
that Whistler was bored and tried to separate them, but it had gone
too far. Finally, Whistler held out his hand and with his charming
quizzical smile said, 'Good-bye, oh, ah, I am so glad to have met you&mdash;on
account of your brother!'</p>

<p>"The year before Whistler died, in December, I went to America
on a short trip. I hadn't been home for a number of years. Whistler
had always said he would go back with me some time, so I telegraphed
him at Bath to induce him to come with me. He replied by telegram,
'Merry Xmas, <i>bon voyage</i>, but I fear you will have to face your country
without me.'"</p>

<p>To anyone familiar with art schools Whistler's idea appeared
revolutionary, but he knew that he was carrying on the tradition of
Gleyre. Art schools are now conducted on such different principles
that a comparison may be useful. Usually the student is not taught to
do anything. The master puts him at drawing, telling him, after the
drawing is finished, where it is wrong. The student starts again and
drops into worse blunders because he has not been told how to avoid
the first. If he improves, it is by accident, or his own intelligence,
more than by teaching. At length, when the pupil has learned enough
drawing to avoid the mistakes of the beginner, and to make it difficult
for the master to detect his faults, he is put at painting, and the problem
becomes twice as difficult for the student. In drawing, each school
has some fixed method of working, nowhere more fixed than at the
Royal Academy, which leads to nothing&mdash;or Paris. In painting, the
professor corrects mistakes in colour, in tone, in value, which is easier
than to correct drawing, and the student becomes more confused than
ever, for he is in colour less likely than in drawing to tumble unaided
on the right thing. As to the use of colours, the mixing of colours,
the arrangement of the palette, the handling of tools&mdash;these are never
taught in modern schools. The result is that the new-comer imitates
the older students&mdash;the favourites&mdash;and shuffles along somehow. Any
attempt on the part of the master to impress his character on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
students would be resented by most of them, and any attempt at
individuality on their part would be resented by the master, for the
official art school, like the official technical school, is the resort of the
incompetent. The Royal Academy goes so far as to change the visitors
in its painting schools&mdash;that is, the teachers&mdash;every month, and the
confusion to the student handed on from Mr. Sargent to Sir Hubert
von Herkomer and then to Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema can hardly be
imagined.</p>

<p>For this sort of art school Whistler had no toleration&mdash;its product
is the amateur or Academician. When he was asked, "Then you would
do away with all the art schools?" Whistler answered, "Not at all,
they are harmless, and it is just as well when the genius appears that
he should find the fire alight and the room warm, an easel close
at hand and the model sitting, but I have no doubt he'll alter the
pose!"</p>

<p>Whistler would have liked to practise the methods of the Old Masters.
He would have taught the students from the beginning, from the
grinding and mixing of the colours. He believed that students should
work with him as apprentices worked with their masters in earlier times.
Artists then taught the student to work as they did. How much
individuality, save the master's, is shown in Rubens' canvases, mostly
done by his pupils? So long as Van Dyck remained with Rubens he
worked in Rubens' manner, learning his trade. When he felt strong
enough to say what he wanted to say in his own way as an accomplished
craftsman, he left the school and set up for himself. Raphael was
trained in Perugino's studio, helped his master, and, when he had
learned all he could there, opened one of his own. And this is the way
Whistler wished his students to work with him. The misfortune is that
he made the experiment when it was too late to profit by the skill
of the pupils whom he wished to train to be of use to him. He knew
that it would take at least five years for students to learn to use the
tools he put in their hands, and the fact that, at the end of three years,
when the school closed, a few of his pupils could paint well enough for
their painting to be mistaken for his shows how right he was. If, after
five years, they could see for themselves the beauty that was around
them, they would by that time have been taught how to paint it in
their own way, for what he could do was to teach them to translate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
their vision on to canvas. Mr. Starr says that Whistler "told me to
paint things exactly as I saw them. 'Young men think they should
paint like this or that painter. Be quite simple, no fussy foolishness,
you know, and don't try to be what they call strong. When a picture
smells of paint,' he said slowly, 'it's what they call strong.'"</p>

<p>Had his health been maintained, had he not been discouraged
because students mostly came to him with the desire to do work which
looked easy, great results would have been accomplished. His regret
was that students did not begin with him. Mrs. Addams has told us of
the great success of one, Miss Prince, who had never been in an art
school. She had nothing to unlearn. She understood, and, at the
end of a year, had made more progress than any. There were exceptions
among the more advanced, men who to-day are well-known
artists and who, looking back, admit how much they learned. Frederick
Frieseke, Henry S. Hubbell, and C. Harry White passed through the
school. One of the few Frenchmen was Simon Bussy, who describes
Whistler as <i>très distingué, très fin, très autoritaire</i>, though not so stimulating
a master as Gustave Moreau, under whom he had been studying.
But the greater number of students, elementary or advanced, thought
that Whistler was going to teach them, by some short cut, to arrive at
distinction. When they found that, though the system was different,
they had to go through the same drudgery as in any school, they were
dissatisfied and left. Moreover, the strict discipline and the separation
of the sexes were unpopular. Nor could they understand Whistler.
Many of his sayings remembered by them explain their bewilderment.</p>

<p>One day, Whistler, going into the class, found three new pupils.
To these he said:</p>

<p>"Where have you studied?"</p>

<p>"With Chase."</p>

<p>"Couldn't have done better!"</p>

<p>"And where have you studied?"</p>

<p>"With Bonnat."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have done better!"</p>

<p>"Where have you studied?"</p>

<p>"I have never studied anywhere, Mr. Whistler."</p>

<p>"I am sure you could not have done better!"</p>

<p>To the young lady who told him that she was painting what she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
saw, he answered, "The shock will come when you see what you
paint!"</p>

<p>To the man who was smoking, he said, "Really, you had better stop
painting, for you might get interested in your work, and your pipe
would go out!"</p>

<p>Of a superior amateur he inquired, "Have you been through
college? I suppose you shoot? Fish, of course? Go in for football,
no doubt? Yes? Well, then I can let you off for painting."</p>

<p>We asked Whistler how much truth there was in these stories. His
answer was: "Well, you know, the one thing I cannot be responsible
for in my daily life is the daily story about me."</p>

<p>But he admitted they were, in the main, true. He added one incident
we have heard from no one else that explains a peculiarity to which
we have referred. In Venice, he said, he got into the habit, as he
worked on his plates, of blowing away the little powder raised by the
needle ploughing through the varnish to the copper, and, unconsciously,
he kept on blowing when painting or drawing. Once, after he had
painted before the students and had left the studio, there was heard in
the silence a sound of blowing. Then another student began blowing
away as he worked, and so they went on. "Well," they said, "already
we have <i>la manière</i>, and that is much." Whistler heard of it and broke
himself of the habit. One day he saw on the wall in the men's studio,
written in charcoal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="left">
<div class="i2"><i>"I bought a palette just like his,</i></div>
<div class="i3"><i>His colours and his brush.</i></div>
<div class="i2"><i>The devil of it is, you see,</i></div>
<div class="i3"><i>I did not buy his touch."</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whistler's methods and manner confused the average students who
came, but his faith in his system was as great as the students' unbelief.
He suggested that his criticisms of their work should be recorded on
a gramophone. He thought of opening another class in London.
The only time E. saw the <i>Académie</i>, towards the beginning of the second
year, the whole place was full of life and go. In the end, the want of
confidence in him, his illness, and his absence broke up the school. But
he sowed seed which will bring forth a thousandfold. For, just as
his theory of art is now recognised as he stated it in <i>The Ten O'Clock</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
so will his practice, proved by his work and teaching, be accepted in
the future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.<br />THE
YEAR NINETEEN HUNDRED.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the spring of 1900 an event of great importance in our relations
with Whistler occurred. Towards the end of May he asked us to
write his Life. Now that his fame was established, a great deal, indeed
far too much, was written about him. Unauthorised publications
appeared or were in preparation, and it was evident that more would
follow. Whistler shrank from being written about by people not in
sympathy with him or incapable of understanding him. He was,
and is, to many critics and commentators a riddle or an affront.
Mistakes were made, facts were distorted. Mr. Heinemann suggested,
first that he should write his autobiography, then that
his biography should be written with his authority by someone in
whom he had confidence. Mr. Heinemann thought of Henley, but
Whistler objected. Mr. Charles Whibley was proposed by Mr. Heinemann,
but again Whistler objected. It was after this that either Mr.
Heinemann or Whistler mentioned the name of Joseph Pennell.</p>

<p>We had been abroad for a few days, and returned to London on
May 28 to find a letter from Mr. Heinemann telling J. of this "magnificent
opportunity." No one could appreciate more fully the honour
as well as the responsibility. J. saw Whistler at once, and said, "You
are the modern Cellini and you should write it yourself."</p>

<p>Whistler had neither the time nor patience, but he promised to
contribute what he could to J.'s book. We knew that while staying
at Whitehall Court he had written two, or perhaps more, autobiographical
chapters at Mr. Heinemann's suggestion. Miss Birnie
Philip, after the first edition of our <i>Life</i> was published, though we had
proved our authority in the English Law Courts, wrote to the <i>Times</i>
(November 24, 1908) that Whistler "stated his objections to biographers
in a fragment written in 1896 of what was intended to be
the story of his life. The following passages will make his opinions
clear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Determined that no mendacious scamp shall tell the foolish
truths about me when centuries have gone by, and anxiety no longer
pulls at the pen of the "pupil" who would sell the soul of his master,
I now proceed to take the wind out of such speculator by immediately
furnishing myself the fiction of my own biography, which shall remain,
and is the story of my life....</p>

<p>"'Curiously, too, I find no grief in noting the closing of more
than one middle-aged eye that I had before now caught turned warily
upon me with a view to future foolscap improved from slight
intimacy....</p>

<p>"'How tiresome, indeed, are the Griswolds of this world, and
how offensive. Pinning their unimportant names on the linen of the
great as they return the intercepted wash, they go down to Posterity
with their impudent bill, and Posterity accepts and remembers them
as the unrequited benefactors of ungrateful genius!'"</p>

<p>This, according to Miss Birnie Philip, was written in 1896. Whistler
added to the record, Mr. Heinemann says, while living with him at
Whitehall Court. But Whistler soon found the task beyond him,
and so, changing his mind on the subject, asked J. to write the story
of his life and his work in 1900.</p>

<p>Almost immediately it was arranged that E. should collaborate and
that we should do the book together. Whistler promised to help us
in every way and, when in the mood, to tell us what he could about
himself and his life, with the understanding that we were to take notes.
He was not a man from whom dates and facts could be forced. His
method was not unlike that of Dr. Johnson, who, when Boswell asked
for biographical details, said, "They'll come out by degrees as we talk
together." Whistler had to talk in his own fashion, or not at all; we
were to listen, no matter where we met or under what conditions.
It was also agreed that there were to be two volumes, one devoted to
his life, the other to his work, and that photographs should be taken
of the pictures in his studio to illustrate the volumes. Whistler's
pictures were being carried off only too quickly, and whatever we needed
for illustration, or as a record, would have to be photographed at once.</p>

<p>The duty of making the notes fell to E., and, from that time until
his death, she kept an account of our meetings with him. He was true
to his promise. We were often in the studio, and he spent evening after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
evening with us. Sometimes we dined with him at Garlant's Hotel
or at the Café Royal, sometimes we met at Mr. Heinemann's, but usually
he dined with us in Buckingham Street, coming so frequently that he
said to us one June evening:</p>

<p>"Well, you know, you will feel about me as I did in the old days
about the man I could never ask to dinner because he was always there!
I couldn't ask him to sit down, because there he always was, already in
his chair!"</p>

<p>Once he told E. to write to J., who was out of town, that he was
living on our staircase. During those evenings he gave us many facts
and much material used in previous chapters. He began by telling
us of the years at home, his student days in Paris, his coming to Chelsea,
and, though dates were not his strong point, we soon had a consecutive
story of that early period. Every evening made us wish more than ever
that he could have written instead of talking, for we soon discovered the
difficulty of rendering his talk. He used to reproach J. with "talking
shorthand," but no one was a greater master of the art than himself.
And so much of its meaning was in the pause, the gesture, the punctuating
hands, the laugh, the adjusting of the eye-glass, the quick look
from the keen blue eyes flashing under the bushy eyebrows. The
impression left with us from the close intercourse of this summer was
of his wonderful vitality, his inexhaustible youth. As yet illness
had not sapped his energy. He was sixty-six, but only the greyness
of the ever-abundant hair, the wrinkles, the loose throat suggested age.
He held himself as erect, he took the world as gaily, his interests were as
fresh as if he were beginning life. Some saw a sign of feebleness in
the nap after dinner, but this was a habit of long standing, and after
ten minutes, or less, he was awake, revived for the talk that went on
until midnight and later.</p>

<p>Whistler wished us to have the photographing in the studio begun
without delay. Our first meeting, after the preliminaries were settled,
was on June 2, 1900; on the 6th the photographer and his assistant
were in Fitzroy Street with J. to superintend. It took long to select
the things which should be done first, Mr. Gray, the photographer,
picking out those which he thought would come best, Whistler preferring
others that Gray feared might not come at all, though the idea was that,
in the end, everything in the studio should be photographed. Whistler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
found himself shoved in a corner, barricaded behind two or three big
cameras, and he could scarcely stir. He grew impatient, he insisted
that he must work. As the light was not good for the photographer,
some canvases were moved out in the hall, some were put on the roof,
but the best place was discovered to be Mr. Wimbush's studio in the
same building. Whistler went with J. through the little cabinets
where pastels and prints were kept, and decided that a certain number
must be worked on, but that the others could be photographed. Then
they lunched together with Miss Birnie Philip, Gray photographing
all the while, and then Whistler's patience was exhausted and everybody
was turned out until the next day, when Gray came again. And the
next day, and many next days, J. would go to Fitzroy Street and
Whistler would say, "Now you must wait," and he would wait in the
little ante-room with Marie, and Whistler would talk away through
the open door until J. was brought into the studio to see the finishing-touches
added to the day's work. This explains the beginning of
our difficulties and the reason why our progress was not rapid.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the fever of work that had taken hold of Whistler.
He dreaded to lose a second. He was rarely willing to leave the studio
during the day or, if he did, it was to work somewhere else, as when he
went to Sir Frank Short's and, as he told us the same evening, pulled
nineteen prints before lunch, and all the joy in it came back, but he did
not return in the afternoon, because, "well, you know, my consideration
for others quite equals my own energy." For himself he had no
consideration, and his work seldom stopped. We remember one late
afternoon during the summer, when he had asked us to come to the
studio, finding tea on the table and Whistler at his easel. "We must
have tea at once or it will get cold," he said, and went on painting.
Ten minutes later he said again, "We must have tea," and again went
on painting. And the tea waited for a half-hour before he could lay
down his brushes, and then it was to place the canvas in a frame and look
at it for another ten minutes. When an invited interruption was to him
a hindrance, he could not but find Mr. Gray, with his huge apparatus,
a nuisance. A good many photographs, however, were made at Fitzroy
Street, and Whistler helped to get permission for pictures to be photographed
wherever the photographing did not interfere with his work.
In England, America, and on the Continent many pictures which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
not been reproduced, and to which access could be obtained, were
photographed.</p>

<p>Nothing interested Whistler more this year than the Universal
Exhibition in Paris, and he and Mr. John M. Cauldwell, the American
Commissioner, understood each other after a first encounter. Mr.
Cauldwell, coming to Paris to arrange the exhibition, with little time
at his disposal and a great deal to do, wrote to ask Whistler to call on
a certain day "at 4.30 sharp." Whistler's answer was that, though
appreciating the honour of the invitation, he regretted his inability
to meet Mr. Cauldwell, as he never had been able and never should be
able to be anywhere "at 4.30 sharp," and it looked as if the unfortunate
experience of 1889 might be repeated. But when Whistler met Mr.
Cauldwell, when he found how much deference was shown him, when
he saw the decoration and arrangement of the American galleries, he
was more than willing to be represented in the American section. He
sent <i>L'Andalouse</i>, the portrait of Mrs. Whibley, <i>Brown and Gold</i>, the
full-length of himself, and, at the Committee's request, <i>The Little White
Girl</i>, never before seen in Paris. He brought together also a fine group
of etchings, and when he learned that he was awarded a <i>Grand Prix</i> for
painting and another for engraving, he was gratified and did not hesitate
to show it. The years of waiting for the official compliment did not
lessen his pleasure when it came. Rossetti retired from the battle at an
early stage, but Whistler fought to the end and gloried in his victory.
He was dining at Mr. Heinemann's when he received the news, and they
drank his health and crowned him with flowers, and he enjoyed it as
fully as the <i>fêtes</i> of his early Paris days. J. was awarded a gold medal
for engraving, and we suggested that the occasion was one for general
celebration, which was complete when Timothy Cole, another gold
medallist, appeared unexpectedly as we were sitting down to dinner.
Mr. Kennedy was one of the party, and Miss Birnie Philip came with
Whistler, and the little dinner was the ceremony he knew how to make
of reunions of the kind. He was pleased when he heard that his medals
were voted unanimously and read out the first with applause. A story
in connection with the awards, told over our table some months later
by John Lambert returning from Paris, amused him vastly. Though
it was agreed that the first medals should not be announced until all
the others were awarded, the news leaked out and got into the papers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
At the next meeting of the jury, Carolus-Duran, always gorgeous, was
more resplendent than ever in a flowered waistcoat. He took the
chair, and at once, with his eye on the American jurors, said that
there had been indiscretion. Alexander Harrison was up like a
shot: "<i>A propos des indiscrétions, messieurs, regardez le gilet de
Carolus!</i>"</p>

<p>During this time Whistler was paying not only for his rooms at the
Hôtel Chatham in Paris, but for one at Garlant's Hotel, in addition to
the apartment in the Rue du Bac where Miss Birnie Philip and her
mother lived the greater part of the year, for the studios in the Rue
Notre-Dame-des-Champs and Fitzroy Street, and lastly, for the "Company
of the Butterfly" in Hinde Street. It was no light burden,
though he had a light way of referring to his "collection of <i>châteaux</i>
and <i>pieds-à-terre</i>." His pockets were as full as he had wanted them,
but he could not get used to their not being empty. Once, afraid he
could not meet one of his many bills for rent, he asked a friend to
verify his bank account, with the result that six thousand pounds were
found to be lying idle.</p>

<p>Whistler, as a "West Point man," followed the Boer War with the
same interest he had shown in the Spanish War. It was a "beautiful
war" on the part of the Boers, for whom he had unbounded admiration.
From Paris, through the winter, he sent us, week by week, Caran
d'Ache's cartoons in the <i>Figaro</i>. In London he cut from the papers
despatches and leaders that reported the bravery of the Boers and the
blunders of the British, and carried them with him wherever he went.
His comments did not amuse the "Islanders," whom, however, he knew
how to soothe after exasperating them almost beyond endurance. One
evening J. walked back with him to Garlant's, and they were having
their whisky-and-soda in the landlady's room while Whistler gave his
version of the news of the day, which he thought particularly psychological.
Then suddenly, when it seemed as if the landlady could not
stand it an instant longer, he turned and said in his most charming
manner, "Well, you know, you would have made a very good Boer yourself,
madam." As he said it, it became the most amiable of compliments,
and the evening was finished over a dish of choice peaches which
she hoped would please him. Another evening, the Boers were on the
point of kindling a fatal war between himself and a good friend, when a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
bang of his fist on the table brought down a picture from the wall of
our dining-room, and in the crash of glass the Boers were forgotten. No
one who met him during the years of the war can dissociate him from
this talk, and not to refer to it would be to give a poor idea of him. If
he had a sympathetic audience, he went over and over the incidents of
the struggle; the wonder of the despatches; Lord Roberts' explanation
that all would have gone well with the Suffolks on a certain occasion
if they had not had a panic. Mrs. Kruger receiving the British Army
while the Boers retired, supplied with all they wanted, though they
went on capturing the British soldiers wholesale; General Buller's
announcement that he had made the enemy respect his rear. When
he was told of despatches stating that Buller, on one occasion, had retired
without losing a man, or a flag, or a cannon, he added, "Yes, or a
minute." He repeated the answer of a man at a lecture, who, when the
lecturer declared that the cream of the British Army had gone to South
Africa, called out, "Whipped cream." The blunderings and the surrenderings
gave Whistler malicious joy, and he declared that as soon as
the British soldier found he was no longer in a majority of ten to one, he
threw up the sponge or dropped the gun. He recalled Bismarck's saying
that South Africa would prove the grave of the British Empire, and
also that the day would come when the blundering of the British
Army would surprise the world, and he quoted "a sort of professional
prophet" who predicted a July that would bring destruction
to the British: "What has July 1900 in store for the Island?" he
would ask.</p>

<p>There was no question of his interest in the Boers, but neither
could there be that this interest was coloured by prejudice. He never
forgot his "years of battle" in England, when, alone, he met the
blunderings, mistakes, and misunderstandings of the army of artists,
critics, and the public. In his old age, as in his youth, he loved London
for its beauty. His friends were there, nowhere else was life so congenial,
and not even Paris could keep him long from London. But it
was his boast that he was an American citizen, that on his father's side
he was Irish, a Highlander on his mother's, and that there was not a drop
of Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins. He had no affection for the people
who persisted in their abuse and ridicule until, confronted by the
Goupil Exhibition of 1892, they were compelled&mdash;however grudgingly&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
to give him his due. This was one reason why he expressed the wish
that none of his pictures should form part of an English national collection,
or remain in England, and emphasised the fact that his sitters at
the end were American or Scotch. He conquered, but the conquest
did not make him accept the old enemies as new friends. In the position
of the Boers he no doubt fancied a parallel with his own when,
alone, they defied the English, who, on the battlefield as in the appreciation
of art, blundered and misunderstood. Whistler's ingenuity in
seeing only what he wanted to see and in making that conform to his
theories was extraordinary. He could not be beaten because, for him,
right on the other side did not exist. He came nearest to it one evening
when discussing the war, not with an Englishman, but with an American
and an officer into the bargain, whom he met in our rooms, and who said
that there was always blundering at the opening of a campaign, as at
Santiago, where two divisions of the United States Army were drawn
up so that, if they had fired, they must have shot each other down.
It was a shock, but Whistler rallied, offered no comment, and was careful
afterwards to avoid such dangerous ground.</p>

<p>Prejudice coloured all his talk of the English, whose characteristics
to him were as humorous as his were incomprehensible to them. It
was astonishing to hear him seize upon a weak point, play with it,
elaborate it fantastically, and then make it tell. The "enemies"
suffered from his wit as he from their density. His artistic sense
served him in satire as in everything else. One favourite subject
was the much-vaunted English cleanliness. He evolved an elaborate
theory:</p>

<p>"Paris is full of baths and always has been; you can see them,
beautiful Louis XV. and Louis XVI. baths on the Seine; in London,
until a few years ago, there were none except in Argyll Street, to which
Britons came with a furtive air, afraid of being caught. And the
French, having the habit of the bath, think and say nothing of it,
while the British&mdash;well, they're so astonished now they have learned
to bathe, they can't talk of anything but their tub."</p>

<p>The Bath Club he described as "the latest incarnation of the
British discovery of water." His ingenious answer was ready when
British virtue was extolled. He repeated to us a conversation at this
time with Madame Sarah Grand. She said it was delightful to be back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
in England after five or six weeks in France, where she had not seen
any men, except two, and they were Germans, whom she could have
embraced in welcome. A Frenchman never would forget that women
are women. She liked to meet men as comrades, without thought of
sex. Whistler told her: "You are to be congratulated, madam&mdash;certainly,
the Englishwoman succeeds, as no other could, in obliging
men to forget her sex."</p>

<p>A few days after, he reported another "happy" answer. He was
with three Englishmen and a German. One of the Englishmen said,
"The trouble is, we English are too honest; we have always been
stupidly honest." Whistler turned to the German: "You see, it is
now historically acknowledged that whenever there has been honesty
in this country, there has been stupidity."</p>

<p>His ingenuity increased with the consternation it caused, and the
"Islander" figured more and more in his talk.</p>

<p>The excitement in China this summer interested him little less
than affairs in South Africa. He was indignant, not with the Chinese
for the alleged massacres at Pekin, but with Americans and Europeans
for considering the massacres an outrage that called for redress. After
all, the Chinese had their way of doing things, and it was better to lose
whole armies of Europeans than to harm the smallest of beautiful things
in that great wonderful country. He said to us one day:</p>

<p>"Here are these people thousands of years older in civilisation than
us, with a religion thousands of years older than ours, and our missionaries
go out there and tell them who God is. It is simply preposterous,
you know, that for what Europe and America consider a question of
honour one blue pot should be risked."</p>

<p>Another evening when he said this to a larger audience, one of the
party asked him if art did not always mark the decadence of a country.
"Well, you know," said Whistler, "a good many countries manage to
go to the dogs without it."</p>

<p>The month of July in London was unusually hot, and for the first
time we heard Whistler complain of the heat, in which, as a rule, he
revelled, though he dressed for it at dinner in white duck trousers and
waistcoat with his dinner-jacket, and in the street exchanged his silk
hat for a wide-brimmed soft grey felt, or a "dandy" straw. He was
restless, anxious to stay in his studio, but, for the sake of Miss Birnie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Philip and her mother, anxious to go to the country or by the sea.
Looking from our windows, he would say that, with the river there and
the Embankment Gardens gay with music and people, we were in no
need to leave town, and we were sure he envied us. One day he went
to Amersham, near London, with the idea of staying there and painting
two landscapes somebody wanted. Mr. Wimbush took him.</p>

<p>"You know, really, I can't say that, towards twilight, it is not pretty
in a curious way, but not really pretty after all&mdash;it's all country, and the
country is detestable."</p>

<p>Eventually he took a house at Sutton, near Dublin, persuaded Mrs.
and Miss Birnie Philip to go there, and then promptly left with Mr.
Elwell for Holland. He told Mr. Sidney Starr once that only one landscape
interested him, the landscape of London. But he made an
exception of Holland. When he was reminded that there is no country
there, he said to us:</p>

<p>"That's just why I like it&mdash;no great, full-blown, shapeless trees
as in England, but everything neat and trim, and the trunks of the trees
painted white, and the cows wear quilts, and it is all arranged and
charming. And look at the skies! They talk about the blue skies of
Italy; the skies of Italy are not blue, they are black. You do not
see blue skies except in Holland and here, where you get great white
clouds, and then the spaces between are blue! And in Holland there
is atmosphere, and that means mystery. There is mystery here, too,
and the people don't want it. What they like is when the east wind
blows, when you can look across the river and count the wires in the
canary bird's cage on the other side."</p>

<p>He stayed a week at Domburg, a small seashore village near Middelburg.
With its little red roofs nestling among the sand-dunes and its
wide beach under the skies he loved, he thought it enchanting, and made
a few water-colours which he showed us afterwards in the studio. The
place, he said, was not yet exploited, and at Madame Elout's he found
good wine and a Dordrecht banker who talked of the Boers and assured
him they were all right, the Dutch would see to that. A visit to
Ireland followed. He went full of expectations, for as the descendant
of the Irish Whistlers he called himself an Irishman. We have a note of
his stay there from the late Sir William Armstrong, Director of the
National Gallery of Ireland:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>"He took a house, 'Craigie' the name of it, at Sutton, six miles
from Dublin, on the spit of sand which connects the Hill of Howth with
the mainland (as the Neutral Ground unites 'Gib.' with Spain) on the
north side of Dublin Bay. There he excited the curiosity of the natives
by at once papering up the windows on the north side of the house,
for half their height, with brown paper. He came to dinner with me
one night, stipulating that he should be allowed to depart at 9.30, as
he was such an early goer to bed. We dined accordingly at 7, and his
Jehu, with the only closed fly the northern half of County Dublin could
supply, was punctually at the door at the hour named. There he had
to wait for three hours, for it was not until 12.30 that the delightful
flow of Whistler's eloquence came to an end, and that he extracted himself
from the deep arm-chair which had been his pulpit for four hours
and a half. His talk had been great, and we had confined ourselves to
little exclamatory appreciations and gazes of rapt adoration! I spent
an hour or two with him in the Irish National Gallery. I found him
there lying on the handrail before a sketch of Hogarth (George II. and
his family) and declaring it was the most beautiful picture in the world.
The only other remark on any particular picture which I can now recall
is his saying of my own portrait by Walter Osborne, 'It has a <i>skin</i>, it has
a <i>skin</i>!' He soon grew tired of Sutton and Ireland, and when I called
at Craigie a few days after the dinner he had flown. He did not
forget to send a graceful word to my wife, signed with his name and
Butterfly."</p>

<p>He did little work during his visit. The house was on the wrong
side of the bay, the weather was wretched, but Chester, on the way
home, was "charming and full of possibilities."</p>

<p>In September the frequent meetings were continued. The talk
drifting here and there, touched upon many subjects belonging to no
particular period, but characteristic of his moods and memories. Thus,
one evening, when Mr. W. B. Blaikie was with us and the talk turned
to Scotland, Whistler told stories of Carlyle. Allingham, he said, was
for a time by way of being Carlyle's Boswell and was always at his heels.
They were walking in the Embankment Gardens at Chelsea, when
Carlyle stopped suddenly: "Have a care, mon, have a care, for ye have
a tur-r-ruble faculty for developing into a bore!" Carlyle had been
reading about Michael Angelo with some idea of writing his life or an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
essay, but it was Michael Angelo, the engineer, who interested him.
Another day, walking with Allingham, they passed South Kensington
Museum. "You had better go in," Allingham said. "Why, mon,
only fools go in there." Allingham explained that he would find
sculpture by Michael Angelo, and he should know something of the
artist's work before writing his life. "No," said Carlyle, "we need
only glance at that."</p>

<p>Whistler's talk of Howell and Tudor House overflowed with
anecdotes of the adventurer, for whom he retained a tender regret, and
the group gathered about Rossetti. He accounted for Howell's downfall
by a last stroke of inventiveness when he procured rare, priceless
black pots for a patron who later discovered rows of the same pots in
an Oxford Street shop. Whistler had a special liking for the story of
Rossetti dining at Lindsey Row, at the height of the blue and white
craze, and becoming so excited when his fish was served on a plate he
had never seen before that he forgot the fish and turned it over, fish and
all, to look at the mark on the back. Another memory was of a dinner
at Mr. Ionides', with Rossetti a pagan, Sir Richard Burton a Mohammedan,
Lady Burton a Catholic. They fell into a hot argument over
religion, but Whistler said nothing. Lady Burton, who was in a state
of exaltation, could not stand his silence: "And what are you, Mr.
Whistler?" "I, madam," he answered, "why, I am an amateur!"
He spent many evenings drawing upon his memory of the "droll" and
"joyous" things of the past. But the past brought him back with redoubled
interest to the present, in which so much waited to be done.</p>

<p>In October we began to notice a change, and we knew that when
he worried there was cause. He was called to Paris once or twice about
the school and his "<i>châteaux</i> and <i>pieds-à-terre</i>." After one of these
journeys he was laid up with a severe cold at Mr. Heinemann's. In
November he was in bed for many days at Garlant's. He had other
worries. British critics conspired either to ignore his success at the
Paris Exhibition, or account for it sneeringly or lyingly. He was
irritated when he read an article on the Exhibition, signed D. S. M., in
the <i>Saturday Review</i> devoted altogether, he told us, to Manet and
Fantin, with only a passing reference to himself:</p>

<p>"Manet did very good work, of course, but then Manet was always
<i>l'écolier</i>&mdash;the student with a certain sense of things in paint, and that
is all!&mdash;he never understood that art is a positive science, one step in
it leading to another. He painted, you know, in <i>la manière noire</i>, the
dark pictures that look very well when you come to them at Durand-Ruel's,
after wandering through rooms of screaming blues and violets
and greens, but he was so little in earnest that midway in his career
he took to the blues and violets and greens himself. You know, it is
the trouble with so many; they paint in one way&mdash;brilliant colour, say&mdash;they
see something, like Ribot, and, dear me, they think, we had
better try to do this too, and they do and, well, really, you know, in the
end they do nothing for themselves!"</p>

<p>He was furious with the critic who stated that his medal was awarded
for <i>The Little White Girl</i>. The statement was offensive because, he
said, "the critics are always passing over recent work for early masterpieces,
though all are masterpieces; there is no better, no worse; the
work has always gone on, it has grown, not changed, and the pictures
I am painting now are full of qualities they cannot understand to-day
any better than they understood <i>The Little White Girl</i> at the time it
was painted."</p>

<p>This was an argument he often used. A few evenings after, he
told a man, who suggested that Millet's later work was not so good
because he was married and had to make both ends meet, "You're
wrong. An artist's work is never better, never worse; it must be always
good, in the end as in the beginning, if he is an artist, if it is in him to
do anything at all. He would not be influenced by the chance of a wife
or anything of that kind. He is always the artist."</p>

<p>He was annoyed because critics could not see a truth which to him
was simple and obvious. His annoyance culminated when the <i>Magazine
of Art</i> not only said the <i>Grand Prix</i> was awarded for <i>The Little
White Girl</i>, but protested against the award, because the picture was
painted before the ten years' limit imposed by the French authorities, a
protest printed in other papers. Whistler could not bear this in silence,
for it looked like an effort to deprive him of his first high award from a
Paris Exhibition. The attack was disgraceful. Whistler's two other
pictures were his most recent, and, as we have said, <i>The Little White
Girl</i> was specially invited. As soon as he was well enough, he came
to us several times, with Mr. William Webb, his solicitor, to talk the
affair over. As a result, an apology was demanded, and made. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
belittling of certain pictures in favour of others, with its inevitable
inference, offended him, in the end as in the beginning. Mr. Sargent
writes us an instance of his manner of carrying off the offence before
the world. Somebody brought him a commission for a painting,
stipulating that it should be "a serious work." Whistler's answer
was that he "could not break with the traditions of a lifetime."</p>

<p>Another worry he should have been spared was a dispute with one
of the tenants at the Rue du Bac, a trivial matter which, in his nervous
state, loomed large and made him unnecessarily miserable. The carpets
of the lady on the floor above him were shaken out of her windows into
his garden, and it could not be stopped. He tried the law, but was
told he must have disinterested witnesses outside the family. If he
engaged a detective, a month might pass before she would do it again.
But it chanced that, while beating a carpet, it fell into his garden, and
his servants refused to give it up. The lady went to law and his lawyer
advised him to return the carpet. It depressed him hopelessly, and as
he had long ceased to live in the Rue du Bac, we could not understand
why he should have heard of so petty a domestic squabble.</p>

<p>Ill and worried as he was, our work at intervals came to a standstill.
When he felt better and stronger the talks went on, but at moments
he seemed almost to fear that the book would prove an obituary. Once
he said to us that we "wanted to make an Old Master of me before my
time," and we had too much respect and affection for him to add to his
worries by our importunity. With the late autumn his weakness
developed into serious illness. By the middle of November he was
extremely anxious about himself, for his cough would not go. The
doctor's diagnosis, he said, was "lowered in tone: probably the result
of living in the midst of English pictures." A sea journey was advised,
and Tangier suggested for the winter. When he was with us he could
not conceal his anxiety. If he sneezed, he hurried away. He fell
asleep before dinner was over; sometimes he could hardly keep awake
through the evening. Once or twice he seemed to be more than
asleep, when there was nothing to do but to rouse him, which was not
easy, and we were extremely frightened until we could, and, indeed,
until J. got him back to Garlant's. He would never trust himself to
the night air until Augustine had mixed him a hot "grog." Tangier
did not appeal to him, and he asked J. to go with him to Gibraltar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
stay a while at Malaga, and then come back by Madrid to see at last the
pictures he had always wanted to see. He was hurt when J.'s work
made it impossible for him to leave London.</p>

<p>In December Whistler gave up the struggle to brave the London
winter, and decided to sail for Gibraltar, on the way to Tangier and
Algiers, with Mr. Birnie Philip, his brother-in-law, to take care of him.
Sir Thomas Sutherland, Chairman of the P. &amp; O. Company, arranged
for every comfort on the voyage. But, as usual, there were complications
at the last moment&mdash;as usual, the fearful trouble of getting
off from his studio. Everybody was pressed into his service and kept
busy, all the waiters in the hotel were in attendance. The day before
he was to start he discovered that his etching plates needed to be regrounded
and he sent them to J., who agreed to do what he could at
such short notice, but warned him that there was not time to ground
the plates properly and that very likely they would be spoiled. Whistler
sent for them in the evening and, instead of leaving them out to dry
until the morning, wrapped them up and packed them among the linen
in his trunk. It was extraordinary that a man so careful about his
work should always have wanted somebody else to ground his plates or
prepare his canvases, or do something as important, that he should
have done for himself, and that oftener than not he should have wanted
it, as on this occasion, at the last moment. However, with the help
of his friends and the waiters and his family, he was got ready in time,
and on December 14 he started for the South.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI: IN SEARCH OF HEALTH.<br />THE YEARS
NINETEEN HUNDRED AND ONE AND NINETEEN HUNDRED
AND TWO.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Whistler got away from London he was unhappy. At
Tangier the wind was icy, at Algiers it rained, and everywhere when
it was clear the sky was "hard" and the sea was "black." Snow
was falling at Marseilles, and he was kept in his room for a couple of
weeks, so ill he had to send for a doctor, and he was only comforted
when he found the doctor delightful. Corsica was recommended and,
as "Napoleon's Island," attracted Whistler. When he was well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
enough Mr. Birnie Philip left him, and he sailed alone for Ajaccio.
Here he stayed at the Hôtel Schweizerhof. The weather at first was
abominable, so cold and the wind so treacherous that he could not work
out of doors, and he felt his loneliness acutely. Fortunately he made
a friend of the Curator of the Museum, and Mr. Heinemann joined
him for a time. They loitered about together in the quaint little
town, went to see the house where Napoleon was born&mdash;"a great
experience"&mdash;spent many rainy hours in the <i>café</i> where Mr. Heinemann
taught him to play dominoes, a resource not only then but the rest of
his life. They played for the price of their coffee, and Whistler cheated
with a brilliancy that made him easily a winner, but that horrified a
German who sometimes took a hand, though the <i>naïveté</i> of Whistler's
"system" could not have deceived a child.</p>

<p>He was by no means idle, and he brought back a series of exquisite
pen and pencil drawings begun at Tangier. A few water-colours were
made, and when the weather gave him a chance he worked on his
copper-plates. He bit one or two that J. had grounded in London,
and the ground came off. He did not know how, or did not have the
courage to prevent it. We can only wonder again that a man who
made such wonderful plates did not know what to do, or did not dare
do it, in difficulties of this sort, preferring to rely upon somebody
else. He had drawn on some of the other plates before he began to
bite any of them, and he may have done more than have as yet been
seen. In Mr. Howard Mansfield's and the Grolier catalogues only
one plate in Corsica is recorded, in both called <i>The Bohemians</i>. But
as J. grounded ten or a dozen for Whistler, and as he spoke to us of
more than once bitten, it is probable that the plates exist. "All my
dainty work lost," he wrote to us from Corsica, and it looked as if the
shadow had fallen upon our friendship. But he understood, and the
shadow passed as quickly as it came. There were other schemes. One
day, after his return, he told Mr. Clifford Addams that he had seen a
great black-bearded shepherd, on a horse, carrying a long pole, coming
down a hill-side, of whom he wanted to make a large equestrian portrait.
But he never started it. He felt he was not able.</p>

<p>The closing of the school in Paris occupied and worried him, and
he was arranging for a show of pastels and prints at the Luxembourg.
One pleasure, of which he wrote to us, came from "new honours" in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
Dresden, where he was awarded a gold medal and elected "unanimously
to the <i>Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts</i>." He was more tired than he
admitted in his letters, dwelling little on his fatigue, and insisting that
the doctor in Marseilles found nothing was the matter with him. But
he was never strong after the autumn of 1900, and earlier than this the
doctor in London warned his friends that he was failing.</p>

<p>He was more hopeful because at Ajaccio he said he had discovered
what was the matter with him:</p>

<p>"At first, though I got through little, I never went out without a
sketch-book or an etching-plate. I was always meaning to work, always
thinking I must. Then the Curator offered me the use of his studio.
The first day I was there he watched me, but said nothing until the
afternoon. Then&mdash;'But, Mr. Whistler, I have looked at you, I have
been watching. You are all nerves, you do nothing. You try to, but
you cannot settle down to it. What you need is rest&mdash;to do nothing&mdash;not
to try to do anything.' And all of a sudden, you know, it struck
me that I had never rested, that I never had done nothing, that it was
the one thing I needed. And I put myself down to doing nothing&mdash;amazing,
you know. No more sketch-books, no more plates. I just
sat in the sun and slept. I was cured. You know, Joseph must sit in
the sun and sleep. Write and tell him so."</p>

<p>He was sufficiently recovered to take his old joy in the "Islanders,"
into the midst of whom he fell on the P. &amp; O. steamer coming back
from Marseilles:</p>

<p>"Nobody but English on board, and, after months of not seeing
them, really they were amazing: there they all were at dinner, you
know&mdash;the women in low gowns, the men in dinner jackets. They
might look a trifle green, they might suddenly run when the ship
rolled&mdash;but what matter? There they were&mdash;men in dinner jackets,
stewards behind their chairs in dinner jackets&mdash;and so all's right with
the country! And, do you know, it made the whole business clear to
me down there in South Africa. At home every Englishman does his
duty&mdash;appears in his dinner jacket at the dinner hour&mdash;and so, what
difference what the Boers are doing? All is well with England! You
know, you might just as well dress to ride in an omnibus!"</p>

<p>Whistler returned from Corsica at the beginning of May in excellent
spirits. He came to us on the day of his arrival. We give one small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
incident that followed because it shows the simplicity he was careful to
conceal from the world he liked to mystify. J. was in Italy and E.,
that afternoon, on her way back from the Continent. At our door he
met our French maid, Augustine, starting for Charing Cross, and he
walked with her to the station, where she was to meet E., while she
gave him the news. Her account was that everybody stared, which
was not surprising. He, always a conspicuous figure, was the more so
in his long brown overcoat and round felt hat, <i>en voyage</i>, while she wore
a big white apron and was <i>en cheveux</i>. Moreover, their conversation
was animated. She invited him to dinner, promising him dishes which
she knew would tempt him, and he accepted. He appeared a little
before eight. "Positively shocking and no possible excuse for it," he
said, "but, well, here I am!"</p>

<p>Work was taken up in the studio, our talks were resumed, his interest
in the Boer War grew, the heat he had not found in the South was
supplied by London in June and July, and from the heat he gained
strength. He came and went, as of old, between Garlant's Hotel and
Buckingham Street, until he declared that the cabbies in the Strand
knew him as well as the cabbies in Chelsea. It had ever been his boast
that he was known to almost every cabman in London, as, indeed, he
was. The tales of his encounters with them were numerous, for, if
lavish in big things, he could sometimes be "narrow" in small, and
his drives occasionally ended in differences. The only time we knew
the cabby to score was one day this year, when J. was walking from
the studio with him. "Kibby, kibby," Whistler cried to a passing
cab, not seeing the "fare" inside. The cabman drew up, looked
down at him, looked him over, and said, "Where did yer buy yer 'at?
Go, get yer 'air cut!" and drove off at a gallop. Whistler, safe inside
an omnibus, laughed at the adventure.</p>

<p>But the summer was full of adventures. Another afternoon he
and J. were walking in the Strand when a well-known English artist
stopped him with, "Why, my dear old Jimmie, how are you? I
haven't seen you or spoken to you for twenty years!" Whistler
turned slowly to J. and said, "Joseph, do you know this person?"
And the person fled. "H'm," said Whistler, "hasn't spoken to me
for twenty years&mdash;guess it will be another twenty before he dares
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>We were abroad a great part of the summer of 1901, and when we
got back his weakness had returned with the cold and the damp and
the fog. He had realised the uselessness of keeping up his apartment
and studio in Paris, the state of his health making it impossible for him
to live in the one or to climb to the other, and business in connection
with closing them took him to Paris in October. Towards the beginning
of the month he was ill in bed at Garlant's Hotel, and towards the end at
Mr. Heinemann's in Norfolk Street. When well enough to go out he
was afraid to come to us in the evening: "Buckingham Street at night,
you know, a dangerous, if fascinating place!" He would not dine
where he could not sleep, he said, "<i>J'y dîne, j'y dort</i>," and in our small
flat he knew there was no corner for him. Early in November he
moved to Tallant's Hotel, North Audley Street, and there he was very
ill and more alarmed than ever. "This time I am very much bowled
over, unable to think," he told E. when she went to see him, and,
though he laughed, he was depressed by his landlady's recommendation
of his room as the one where Lord &mdash;&mdash; died. "I tried to make her
understand," he said, "that what I wanted was a room to live in." He
looked the worse because in illness, as in health, he had the faculty of
inventing extraordinary costumes. E. remembers him there, after he
was able to get up, in black trousers, a white silk night-shirt flowing
loose, and a short black coat.</p>

<p>Illness made Whistler more of a wanderer, and for months he was
denied the rest he knew he needed. From Tallant's, in November, he
went to Mrs. Birnie Philip's in Tite Street, Chelsea. Here he never
asked his friends, and we saw less of him. The first week in December
he left London for Bath, where he took rooms in one of the big Crescents,
and where he thought he could work. There were shops in which to
hunt for "old silver and things," in a vague way people seemed to
know him, and, on the whole, Bath pleased him. He lost few excuses,
however, for coming to London, and was in town almost all of January.
On some days he was surprisingly well. He went to the Old Masters
Exhibition at the Royal Academy especially to see the Kingston Lacy
<i>Las Meniñas</i>, and he told us the same day:</p>

<p>"It is full of things only Velasquez could have done&mdash;the heads a
little weak perhaps&mdash;but so much, or everything, that no one else
could have painted like that. And up in a strange place they call the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
Diploma Gallery I saw the Spanish Phillip's copy of Las Meniñas, full
of atmosphere really, and dim understanding."</p>

<p>Ochtervelt's <i>Lady Standing at a Spinet</i> interested him, suggesting
a favourite theme:</p>

<p>"The Dutchmen knew how to paint&mdash;they had respect for the
surface of a picture; the modern painter has no respect for anything
but his own cleverness, and he is sometimes so clever that his work is
like that of a bad boy, and I'm not sure that he ought not to be taken
out and whipped for it. Cleverness!&mdash;well, cleverness has nothing
to do with art; there can be the same sort of cleverness in painting as
that of the popular officer who cuts an orange into fancy shapes after
dinner."</p>

<p>He was severe on contemporary artists who forgot the standard of
the Louvre, the only standard he recognised. Of Conder he said,
"<i>Il est trop joli pour être beau!</i>" and of a follower of Rodin, "He makes
a landscape out of a man." When he saw Watts' <i>Hope</i> his comment
was, "The hope that maketh the heart sick." Watts he always called
"<i>ce faux Titien</i>." "Except in England, would anything short of
perfection in art be praised?" he said. "Why approve the tolerable
picture any more than the tolerable egg?" A sitter dissatisfied with
his portrait told Whistler it was not good. "Do you call it a good
piece of art?" he asked. "Well," said Whistler, "do you call yourself
a good piece of Nature?"</p>

<p>One day a man rushed into a hat store and, as Whistler was hatless,
being fitted, bellowed, "I say, this hat don't fit." "Your coat don't,
either," Whistler answered.</p>

<p>One or two evenings he risked the night air to come to us and his
talk was as gay and brilliant&mdash;reminiscent, critical, "wicked," as the
mood took him, and at times serious. We remember his earnestness
when he recalled the <i>séances</i> and spiritual manifestations at Rossetti's,
in which he believed. He could not understand the people who
pretended to doubt the existence of another world and the hereafter.
His faith was strong, though vague when there was question of analysing
it. Probably he never tried to reduce it to dogma and doctrine, and,
in that sense, he was "the amateur" he described himself in jest. If
his inclination turned to any special creed it was to Catholicism. "The
beauty of ritual is with the Catholics," he said. But his work left him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
no time to study these problems, and his belief perhaps was stimulated
by the mystery in which it was lost. He would have been more
amused and interested than anybody could he have foreseen the
messages to be received from him by an artist, and the book to be
written by him for an author, and the portrait to be made by him
for a medium, after his death.</p>

<p>On other days London apparently was tiring him and he dozed off
and on through his visits. He expended much energy in sending some
old pieces of silver to the doctor at Marseilles and the Curator at
Ajaccio, who had been kind to him. He was full of these little courtesies
and never forgot kindness, just as he never failed to show it to those
who appealed to him, whether it was to find a publisher for an
unsuccessful illustrator, or a gallery for an unsuccessful painter, or even,
as we know happened once, to support a morphomaniac for months.</p>

<p>A shorter visit to town was made solely to attend a meeting of the
International Society because his presence was particularly desired.
This was one of the occasions that proved the sincerity and activity of
his devotion to the Society and its affairs. It is a satisfaction that this
devotion was appreciated and that the loyalty of the Council was not
shaken during his lifetime.</p>

<p>In March Whistler came back to Tite Street, but, as we have said,
he asked no one while he stayed with "the Ladies," his name for his
mother- and sisters-in-law. There was one almost clandestine meeting
with Professor Sauter, Whistler's desire to hear about the Boers, to
whom he "never referred, of course, in the presence of the Ladies,"
becoming too strong to be endured, and he could rely upon Sauter for
sympathy and the latest news. It was an interval of mystery in the
studio. No one was invited, few were admitted, nothing was heard of
the work being done. Whistler liked to keep up an effect of mystery in
his movements, but we have never known him to carry it so far as
during the first month or so after his return from Bath. At last J.
was summoned. Whistler would not let him come further than the
ante-room, talking to him through the open door or the thin partition,
but presently, probably forgetting, called him into the studio and went
on painting, and he forgot the mystery. Whistler felt he had little
strength and devoted that little to his work. But, even in ill-health,
he could not live without people about him, and he soon fell back into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
his old ways. Miss Birnie Philip was now almost always in the studio
with him. In April he showed us the portrait of Mr. Richard A.
Canfield, whose acquaintance he made at this time, unfortunately, for
he introduced Mr. Canfield to "the Ladies," and the introduction
resulted in the loss of one of his friends. Miss Birnie Philip was sitting
to him, he was working on the portrait of Miss Kinsella, the <i>Venus</i>, and
the little heads, and he was adding to the series of pastels. He was
bothered about the show of his prints and pastels which M. Bénédite
wished to make at the Luxembourg, and he was anxious to hand over
the details to J., who could not see to them as he was away constantly
this year. Whistler looked forward to the show because of the official
character it would have, though after recent purchases of pictures for
the Luxembourg he said, "You know, really, I told Bénédite, if this
goes on I am afraid I must take my 'Mummy' from his Hotel." He
was worried also about a show at the Caxton Club in Chicago, where
it was proposed to reproduce his etchings without his permission. But
when the Club found he objected the matter dropped.</p>

<p>To avoid further wandering, for which he was no longer equal, he
took a house in Chelsea, where he had lived almost thirty years: he had
been absent hardly more than ten. Mrs. and Miss Birnie Philip went
to live with him. The house, not many doors west of old Chelsea
Church, was No. 74 Cheyne Walk, built by Mr. C. R. Ashbee, and it
stood on the site of a fish-shop of which Whistler had made a lithograph.
There was a spacious studio at the back in which, in his words, he returned
to his "old scheme of grey." Its drawbacks were that it was on
a lower level than the street, reached by a descent of two or three steps
from the entrance hall, and that the rest of the house was sacrificed
to it. Two flights of stairs led up to the drawing-room where, in glass
cases running round the room, he placed his blue-and-white. The
dining-room was on this floor, but another flight of stairs had to
be climbed to get to the bedrooms in the garrets. Almost all the
windows opening upon the river were placed so high, and filled with
such small panes, that little could be seen from them of the beauty
of the Thames and its banks so dear to Whistler. The street door
was of beaten copper and the house was full of decorative touches,
which, he said, "make me wonder what I am doing here anyhow&mdash;the
whole, you know, a successful example of the disastrous effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
of art upon the British middle classes." Into this house he moved
in April.</p>

<p>He reserved his energy for his work and went out scarcely at all. He
did not dare risk the dinner given in May by London artists to Rodin,
who, however, breakfasted with him a day or two after. We mention
a detail that shows how sensitive Whistler was on certain subjects.
M. Lantéri and Mr. Tweed came with Rodin, and this is Whistler's
account to us later on the same day:</p>

<p>"It was all very charming. Rodin distinguished in every way&mdash;the
breakfast very elegant&mdash;but&mdash;well, you know, you will understand.
Before they came, naturally, I put my work out of sight, canvases up
against the wall with their backs turned. And you know, never once,
not even after breakfast, did Rodin ask to see anything, not that I
wanted to show anything to Rodin, I needn't tell you&mdash;but in a man
so distinguished it seemed a want of&mdash;well, of what West Point would
have demanded under the circumstances."</p>

<p>No doubt Rodin thought, from the careful manner in which work
was put out of sight, that he was not expected to refer to it. His
opinion of Whistler we know, for he wrote it to us:</p>

<p>"<i>Whistler était un peintre dont le dessin avait beaucoup de profondeurs,
et celles-ci furent préparées par de bonnes études, car il a dû étudier assidument.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Il sentait la forme, non seulement comme le font les bons peintres mais
de la manière des bons sculpteurs. Il avait un sentiment extrêmement fin,
qui a fait croire à quelques-uns que sa base n'était pas forte, mais elle était,
au contraire, et forte et sûre.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Il comprenait admirablement l'atmosphère, et un de ses tableaux qui
m'a le plus vivement impressionné, 'La Tamise (barrage) à Chelsea,' est
merveilleux au point de vue de la profondeur de l'espace. Le paysage en
somme n'a rien; il n'y a que cette grande étendue d'atmosphère, rendue avec
un art consommé.</i></p>

<p>"<i>L'&oelig;uvre de Whistler ne perdra jamais par le temps; elle gagnera;
car une de ses forces est l'énergie, une autre la délicatesse; mais la principale
est l'étude du dessin.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>His visits to us were on Sundays, when he came for noonday breakfast,
alone or with Miss Birnie Philip. If possible, we had people he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
liked or was interested in to meet him. One Sunday the late Mrs.
Sarah Whitman, of Boston, and Miss Tuckerman were of the party,
and Whistler, though he arrived tired and listless, recovered his
animation before breakfast was over, and, for the new audience,
described again the house in which he was so astonished to find himself,
and again summed up the Boer campaign. Once he braved the
night and dined, June 12&mdash;the last time he dined at our table&mdash;and
was so wonderful we forgot how ill he was. We asked Mr. and Mrs.
Harrison Morris and Professor Sauter, and Mr. Morris brought a
message from General Wheeler, then in London and delighted to
have news of Whistler, whom he remembered so well in the class
above him at West Point. To be remembered by a distinguished
West Point man was charming, but Whistler would not hear of General
Wheeler being in the class below him; it was the class above; for
Whistler did not choose to be older than anybody. We have spoken
of his prejudices. He gave that evening an instance of one of the
strongest. Something was said of the negro; he refused to see "any
good in the nigger, he did not like the nigger," and that was the end
of it. But Mr. Morris argued that it depended on the nigger; some
he would be glad to invite to his house and to dinner. "Well, you
know," said Whistler, "I should say that depends not on the nigger,
but on the season of the year!" This reminds us of his argument
another evening with Mrs. T. Fisher Unwin. But the negro had
never had a chance, Mrs. Unwin protested. "Never had a chance!"
said Whistler, "why, there, you know, there they all were starting out
equal&mdash;the white man, the yellow man, the brown man, the red man,
the black man&mdash;what better chance could the black man have? If he
got left, well, it's because he couldn't keep up in the race."</p>

<p>On these last visits there was another subject he could not keep
long out of his thoughts and his talk. He had not been many days in
his new house before building was begun by Mr. Ashbee on a vacant
lot next door. "It is knock, knock, knock all day," Whistler said, and
his resentment was unbounded. In his nervous state the perpetual
irritation, the feeling that advantage had been taken of him and that
he had not been informed of the nuisance beforehand, put him into a
rage. Mr. Ashbee has written us that Whistler knew a building was
to be put up. Those who took the house may have known, but Whistler
told us he did not until the work began. Excitement, above all, the
doctor said, must be avoided as it was bad for his heart. There was
no mistaking the effect of this endless annoyance. He hoped for legal
redress, and he referred the matter to Mr. Webb. But the knocking
continued. On June 17 E. dined with him at Cheyne Walk, the one
other guest Mr. Freer, recently arrived from Detroit, and it seemed to
her as if Whistler was fast losing the good done by the winter's rest and
quiet. Mrs. and Miss Birnie Philip were uneasy, and it came as no
surprise to hear a few days later that he had left the house in search of
repose and distraction in Holland, with Mr. Freer as his companion. It
was too late. At The Hague, where he stayed in the Hôtel des Indes,
he was dangerously ill, at death's door. Mr. Freer remained as long as
he could, and Miss Birnie Philip and Mrs. Whibley hurried to take care
of him. The period was critical. There was no suggestion of it in
the first public sign he gave of convalescence. A stupid reporter
telegraphed from The Hague that the trouble with Whistler "was old
age, and it would take him a long time to get over it." The <i>Morning
Post</i> published an article that Whistler thought had been prepared in
anticipation of death, which, sparing him for the time, spared also the
old wit. He wrote to beg that the "ready wreath and quick biography
might be put back into their pigeon-hole for later use"; in reference
to the writer's description of him he apologised for "continuing to
wear my own hair and eyebrows after distinguished <i>confrères</i> and
eminent persons have long ceased the habit"; and those who read the
letter could not imagine that, a few days previously, his letter-writing
seemed at an end. It contained his last word about Swinburne, and in
it the bitterness with which he wrote <i>Et tu, Brute!</i> in <i>The Gentle Art</i> had
disappeared. The <i>Morning Post</i> stated that Swinburne's verses inspired
<i>The Little White Girl</i>. Whistler explained that the lines "were only
written in my studio after the picture was painted. And the writing
of them was a rare and graceful tribute from the poet to the painter&mdash;a
noble recognition of work by the production of a nobler one."</p>

<p>After Mr. Freer had gone, Mr. Heinemann, at Whistler's urgent
appeal, joined him in The Hague, a fortunate circumstance, as two
charming spinster cousins, the Misses Norman, were able to find for
the patient comforts out of reach of a stranger. They took rooms for
him near the Hôtel des Indes, suggested a nurse, prepared dishes for
him, and interested The Hague artists in his presence. Mesdag,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
Israels, and Van 's Gravesande were attentive. Afterwards, Van 's Gravesande
wrote:</p>

<p>"<i>Je l'ai beaucoup aimé. Whistler, malgré tout son quarrelling avec
tout le monde, c'était un 'très bon garçon' tout à fait charmant entre
camarades. J'ai passé quelques jours avec lui, il y déjà une vingtaine
d'années, à Dordrecht nous y avons fait des croquis, des promenades sur
l'eau, etc. etc. J'en garde toujours un excellent souvenir. On ne peut pas
s'imaginer un compagnon plus gentil que lui, enjoué, aimable, sans aucune
prétention, enthousiaste, et avec cela travailleur comme pas un.</i>"</p>

<p>Whistler enjoyed the society of his doctor&mdash;"the Court Doctor,
quite the most distinguished in Holland." Mr. Clifford Addams came
for a while from Dieppe, and in September E. went to Holland.
Whistler was so much better that he made the short journey from The
Hague to Amsterdam, where she was staying, to ask her to go with him
to the Rijks Museum and look at the <i>Effie Deans</i>, which he had not seen
in the gallery, and the Rembrandts. It is not easy for her to forgive
the chance that took her away from the hotel before the telegram
announcing his visit was delivered. She heard of him afterwards at
Müller's book-shop, where he had been in search of old paper, for which
they said his demand in Amsterdam had been so great and constant
that dealers placed a fabulous price upon it. E. the next day went to
The Hague, where she found him in rooms that in the last hours of
packing looked bare and comfortless, for he had decided to start at once
for London. He had promised to lunch with his doctor, so that she
saw only enough of him to realise how frail and depressed and irritable
illness had left him. His sisters-in-law told her that the doctor said he
could keep well only by the greatest care and constant watchfulness,
that he must not be excited, that he must not walk up many stairs.</p>

<p>Professor Sauter was more fortunate than E., and we have his
notes of Whistler at The Hague when, with the first cheerful days of
his recovery, his interest in life seemed to revive:</p>

<p>"Realising the difficulty of conveying my vivid impressions, I have
hesitated for so long to give you an account of our experiences with
Whistler during the last days of August and the beginning of September
1902, in Holland, soon after the severe illness which he suffered.</p>

<p>"A letter which I received in the beginning of August was sufficient
proof that he was convalescent, and that he had regained his interest
in many affairs, and that he was enjoying The Hague and the Hôtel des
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
Indes, but also that he was longing for the society of friends from London.
Towards the end of August our journey to Belgium and Holland
brought us to The Hague, and of course our first visit was to him.</p>

<p>"It was indeed a pleasure to hear his gay voice, after he had received
our card, calling down from the top of the stairs,'Are you there? Just
wait a bit&mdash;I will be down in a moment.' In a few minutes his thin,
delicately dressed figure appeared, in his face delight, gay as a schoolboy
released from school and determined to have an outing.</p>

<p>"He had then removed to apartments a few doors from the hotel,
but to the latter he invited us to lunch. With intense appreciation
Whistler spoke of the attention and consideration shown to him by the
hotel people during his illness. All was sun, like the beautiful sunny
warm August day, and as if to give proof of his statements about the
cooking, management, and everything in the hotel, he ordered lunch
with great care.</p>

<p>"He was full of gaiety, and his amusement over the obituary and
his own reply to it was convincing enough that neither his spirit nor
his memory had suffered.</p>

<p>"After lunch, Whistler insisted on taking us for a drive to show us
the 'charming surroundings' of The Hague and the Bosch. We
drove also to Scheveningen. He was full of admiration and love for
The Hague.</p>

<p>"On the way to Scheveningen the real state of his health became
alarmingly evident. He looked very ill and fell asleep in the carriage,
but to my suggestion to drive home and have a rest he would not
listen.</p>

<p>"It was a glorious afternoon, and the calm sea with the little white
breakers, the sand with hundreds of figures moving on it, and children
playing in gay dresses, made a wonderful picture to enjoy in his
company.</p>

<p>"About 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we brought him to his rooms after arranging to
visit the Mauritshuis together next day.</p>

<p>"About 11.30 next morning we met in the gallery, and wandered
from room to room. He was all alive and bright again, and there he
showed particular interest in and affection for Rembrandt's <i>Father</i>, and
spoke of it as a fine example of the mental development of the artist,
which, he said, should be continuous from work to work up to the end.</p>

<p>"I mentioned that we were going to the Vieux Doelen to lunch to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
meet General De Wet; his interest in this announcement was intense,
and I had to promise to tell him all about it in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"On coming to the two portraits by Franz Hals he examined the
work with undisguised delight, but the full disclosure of feeling towards
the Master of Haarlem was reserved to us for the next day.</p>

<p>"On my saying, 'We are going to Haarlem to-morrow,' Whistler
promptly replied, 'Oh, I might come along with you.'</p>

<p>"In his delicate state of health this reply was startling indeed, and
realising the responsibility of allowing him to undertake even the small
journey away from his rooms and doctor, I replied, 'But we are leaving
by an early train.' 'Oh, then I might follow later on,' he finished.</p>

<p>"Thus we parted, he to his rooms, we to the Vieux Doelen.</p>

<p>"About 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I went round to give him an account of my meeting
with De Wet, which aroused the greatest curiosity, and many questions
I had to face.</p>

<p>"When I asked him whether he had seen the Generals, he said,
'You see, I just drove round and left my cards on their Excellencies.'</p>

<p>"But still the journey of Haarlem occupied his mind, and before
I left him it came out: 'Well, you are going to Haarlem early to-morrow?
Perhaps I will see you there.'</p>

<p>"I certainly would never have dreamt for a moment that he would
carry out what I took for passing fancy, and intense was my astonishment
when next day about noon at the Haarlem Gallery I saw Whistler
in the doorway, smilingly looking towards me, saying, 'Ah, I just
wanted to see what you are doing.'</p>

<p>"From this moment until we took the train at the Haarlem Station
back to The Hague a nature revealed itself in its force and subtlety,
its worship for the real and its humility before the great, combining
the experience of age with the enthusiasm of youth.</p>

<p>"Hardly could I get Whistler away for a small lunch.</p>

<p>"We wandered along the line from the early <i>St. George's Shooting
Guild</i> of 1616 down to the old women of 1664.</p>

<p>"Certainly no collection would give stronger support to Whistler's
theory that a master grows in his art, from picture to picture, till the
end, than that at Haarlem.</p>

<p>"We went through the life with Hals the people portrayed on the
canvases, his relations with, and attitude towards, his sitters; he
entered in his mind into the studio to examine the canvas before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
picture was started and the sitters arrived, how Hals placed the men in
the canvas in the positions appropriate to their ranks, how he divined
the character, from the responsible colonel down to the youthful dandy
lieutenant, and how he revelled in the colours of their garments!</p>

<p>"As time went on Whistler's enthusiasm increased, and even the
distance between the railing and the picture was too great for this
intimate discourse. All of a sudden, he crept under the railing close
up to the picture, but lo! this pleasure could not last for long.</p>

<p>"The attendant arrived and gave him in unmistakable words to
understand that this was not the place from which to view the pictures.</p>

<p>"And Whistler crawled obediently back from his position, but not
discouraged, saying, 'Wait&mdash;we will stay after they are gone,' pointing
to the other visitors.</p>

<p>"Matters were soon arranged with the courteous little chief attendant
down in the hall, who, pointing to the signature in the visitors'
book, asked, '<i>Is dat de groote Schilder?</i>' (Is that the great painter?)
and on my confirming it, pressed his hands together, bent a little
on one side, opened his eyes and mouth wide, and exclaimed under
his breath, 'Ach!' He was a rare little man.</p>

<p>"We were soon free from fellow visitors and watchful attendants,
and no more restrictions were in the way for Whistler's outburst of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"We were indeed alone with Franz Hals.</p>

<p>"Now nothing could keep him away from the canvases; particularly
the groups of old men and women got their full share of appreciation.</p>

<p>"He went under the railing again, turning round towards me,
saying, 'Now, <i>do</i> get me a chair.' And after it was pushed under the
railing, he went on, '<i>And now, do</i> help me on the top of it.' From
that moment there was no holding him back. He went absolutely into
raptures over the old women, admiring everything; his exclamation
of joy came out now at the top of his voice, now in the most tender,
almost caressing whisper: 'Look at it&mdash;just look; look at the beautiful
colour&mdash;the flesh&mdash;look at the white&mdash;that black&mdash;look how those
ribbons are put in. Oh, what a swell he was&mdash;can you see it all?&mdash;and
the character&mdash;how he realised it.' Moving with his hand so near the
picture as if he wanted to caress it in every detail, he screamed with
joy: 'Oh, I must touch it&mdash;just for the fun of it,' and he moved
tenderly with his fingers over the face of one of the old women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was the real Whistler&mdash;the man, the artist, the painter&mdash;there
was no 'Why drag in Velasquez?' spirit&mdash;but the spirit of a
youth, full of ardour, full of plans, on the threshold of his work, oblivious
of the achievements of a lifetime.</p>

<p>"He went on to analyse the picture in its detail.</p>

<p>"'You see, <i>she</i> is a grand person'&mdash;pointing to the centre figure&mdash;'she
wears a fine collar, and look at her two little black bows&mdash;she is the
treasurer&mdash;she is the secretary&mdash;she keeps the records'&mdash;pointing at
each in turn with his finger.</p>

<p>"With a fierce look in his eye, as though he would repulse an attack
on Hals, and in contemptuous tone, he burst out, 'They say he was
a drunkard, a coarse fellow; don't you believe it&mdash;they are the coarse
fellows. Just imagine a drunkard doing these beautiful things!'</p>

<p>"'Just look how tenderly this mouth is put in&mdash;you must see the
portrait of himself and his wife at the Rijks Museum. He was a
swagger fellow. He was a cavalier&mdash;see the fine clothes he wears.
That is a fine portrait, and his lady&mdash;she is charming, she is lovely.'
In time, however, the excitement proved too much for him in his
weak state, and it was high time to take him away into the fresh air.
He appeared exhausted, and I feared a collapse after such emotions.</p>

<p>"During my absence in looking for a carriage he went on talking
to Mrs. Sauter. 'This is what I would like to do, of course, you know,
in my own way'&mdash;meaning the continual progress of his work to the
last. 'Oh, I would have done anything for my art.' It was a great
relief to have him safely seated in the carriage with us.</p>

<p>"Once there he soon regained his spirits, and, as we had expected
to meet Mrs. Pennell at the Gallery, but looked in vain for her, we now
drove from hotel to hotel in search of her, and on this expedition a truly
Whistlerian incident happened. Stopping before one of the hotels, he
requested to see the proprietor, who appeared immediately at the side
of the carriage, a tall, solemn-looking gentleman, with a long reddish
beard, bowing courteously, but the gentleman could give no information
about Mrs. Pennell's arrival at his hotel. After minute inquiries about
the place, Whistler turned to him, asking, '<i>Monsieur</i>, what hotel would
you recommend in Haarlem if you would recommend any?' to which
he promptly and seriously replied, '<i>Monsieur</i>, if I would recommend an
hotel in Haarlem I would recommend my own.' 'Thank you, <i>Monsieur</i>,
thank you,' responded Whistler, touching his hat, bowing slightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
And we drove on soon, to arrive at the hotel where we intended to take
tea, and rest.</p>

<p>"Soon we were happily settled on our return journey, in a special
compartment, which he was, in his chivalrous consideration towards
ladies, most anxious to reserve, as he put it, 'to make Mrs. Sauter
comfortable&mdash;she is tired.'</p>

<p>"With it, a day full of emotions, amusement, and anxieties came to
an end&mdash;and, as it proved to Whistler, the last pilgrimage to Franz Hals.</p>

<p>"It needed no persuasion to keep Whistler at home after so fatiguing
a day.</p>

<p>"But on our return to the hotel late the next afternoon we were
told that he had called three times, and finally left a note asking us to
come round in the morning and also to bring him news of Mrs. Pennell.</p>

<p>"Monday was a fête day for Holland&mdash;the Queen's birthday, and
the town gay with flags and orange streamers and happy holiday crowds.</p>

<p>"I went round early to keep him company and bring him the news
he wished for.</p>

<p>"We sat at his window overlooking merry-go-rounds, little toy and
sweet stalls, and throngs of little children in their loyal smart frocks.</p>

<p>"'What a pretty sight! If I only had my water-colours here I
could do a nice little picture,' he remarked.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bisschop had kindly arranged to take us and Mr. Bruckmann
to the Gallery of Mesdag, and Whistler accepted an invitation to
join us.</p>

<p>"There the Canalettos were of chief interest to him. Lunch at a
<i>café</i>, another visit to the Mauritshuis, and tea at his rooms brought
our stay to an end."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII: THE END.<br /> THE YEARS NINETEEN
HUNDRED AND TWO AND NINETEEN HUNDRED AND
THREE.</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whistler</span> came back to No. 74 Cheyne Walk, to the noise of building,
to the bedroom at the top of the house&mdash;to the conditions against
which the doctor's warning was emphatic. When E. saw him about
the middle of September on her return&mdash;J. was still away&mdash;he had
been again ill and was confined to his room. On her next visit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
within a few days, he was in bed, but he had moved downstairs to
a small room adjoining the studio, intended, no doubt, for a model's
dressing-room. In one way it was an improvement, for there were
no stairs and his studio was close at hand whenever he had strength
for work, but the only window looked upon the street, and the clatter
of children and traffic was added to the builders' knocking.</p>

<p>Except in this house, we never saw him after his return from The
Hague. At times, in the winter and spring, he was able to go out in
a carriage, but the three flights of stairs to our flat rose between him
and us, an insurmountable barrier. Therefore there were seldom the
old long intimate talks, for he was not often alone in the studio.
Miss Birnie Philip was usually with him, sometimes sitting apart with
her knitting, and only rarely drawn into the conversation. Mrs.
Whibley was frequently there, and before "the Ladies" there were
reservations, for with many things they were not to be "troubled."
This involved a restraint in himself and a sensation of oppression in
his visitors. Then there was a coming and going of models, visits
from his doctors, his solicitor, his barber, and many other people who
helped to distract him. His friends were devoted, encouraged by him
and knowing he welcomed anyone from the world without; Mr. Luke
Ionides, oldest of all, Mrs. Whistler, Mr. Walton, who lived next door,
Professor Sauter, Sir John Lavery, Mr. and Mrs. Addams, his apprentices,
Arthur Studd, his near neighbour, drifted in and out almost daily.
He was bored when alone and unable to work, though he had of recent
years developed an extraordinary passion for reading. But, as a
matter of fact, he was hardly ever lonely, for he was surrounded as he
liked in his studio, and yet he felt his condition and grew restless, so that
his wish to rejoin Mr. Heinemann in "housekeeping" seemed natural.</p>

<p>Whistler had intervals when his energy returned, and he worked
and hoped. We knew on seeing him when he was not so well, for his
costume of invalid remained original. He clung to a fur-lined overcoat
worn into shabbiness. In his younger years he had objected to a
dressing-gown as an unmanly concession; apparently he had not outgrown
the objection, and on his bad days this shabby worn-out overcoat
was its substitute. Nor did the studio seem the most comfortable
place for a man so ill as he was. It was bare, with little furniture, as
his studios always were, and he had not used it enough to give it the
air of a workshop. The whole house showed that illness was reigning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
there. The hall had a more unfinished, more unsettled look than
the entrance at the Rue du Bac, and it was sometimes strewn with the
trays and odds and ends of the sickroom. Papers and books lay on the
floor of the drawing-room, in contrast to the blue-and-white in the cases.
A litter of things at times covered the sideboard in the dining-room.
Everywhere you felt the cheerlessness of a house which is not lived
in. When we saw Whistler in his big, shabby overcoat shuffling about
the huge studio, he struck us as so old, so feeble and fragile that we
could imagine no sadder or more tragic figure. It was the more tragic
because he had always been such a dandy, a word he would have been
the first to use in reference to himself. We recall his horror once
when he heard a story that represented him as untidy and slovenly.
"I!" he said, "I, when if I had only an old rag to cover me I would
wear it with such neatness and propriety and the utmost distinction!"
But no one would have suspected the dandy in this forlorn little old
man, wrapped in a worn overcoat, hardly able to walk. On his bad
days there was not much walking about, and he lay stretched on an
easy chair, talking little, barely listening, and dozing. His nights were
often sleepless&mdash;he had lost the habit of sleep, he told us, and as the day
went on he became so drowsy that it seemed as if nothing could rouse
him from what was more like death than sleep. Sometimes, sitting by
the table where tea was served, he would drop his forehead on the edge
of the table, fall asleep, and remain motionless for an hour and more. A
pretty little cat, brown and gold and white, that lived in the studio, was
often curled up on his lap, sleeping too. His devotion to her was
something to remember, and we have seen him get up, when probably
he would not have stirred for any human being, just to empty the
stale milk from her saucer and fill it up with fresh. A message was
sent to E., one day, to announce the birth of her first kittens, that also
made the studio their home and became a source of mild distraction
to the invalid.</p>

<p>On his good days he liked to play dominoes after tea and he cheated
with his accustomed tricks. He often kept J. for a game and sometimes
for dinner with himself and Miss Birnie Philip in the studio, the climb
to the dining-room out of the question. There were times when he
would say he never could get back to work again, but others when he
managed to work with not only the old vigour, but the old mastery. He
had an Irish model, Miss Dorothy Seton, whose red hair was remarkably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
beautiful and whose face Whistler thought as remarkable, for it reminded
him of Hogarth's <i>Shrimp Girl</i>. One afternoon J. found him
painting her, her red hair hanging over her shoulders and an apple in her
hand, the picture to which the title <i>Daughter of Eve</i> was eventually
given. He was walking up and down the studio in delight, looking almost
strong, and he seized J. by the arm in the old fashion and walked
him up and down too. "Well, Joseph, how long do you think it took
me to paint that, now?" and not for weeks had he shown such animation
as when he added, "It was done in a couple of hours this very
morning." So far as we know, it was the last important picture he
painted, and it was, as J. then saw it, the finest thing of his latest period.
He must have painted on it again, for at the Paris Memorial Exhibition
the bloom of its beauty had faded. Now and then he worked on a portrait
of Miss Birnie Philip, and he was anxious to continue the portrait,
started a year or so before, of Mrs. Heinemann, which needed only a
few more sittings, but, to the world's loss, these could not be arranged.
He saw to cleaning the <i>Rosa Corder</i>, which Mr. Canfield, who was back
in London and buying pictures, drawings, and prints in the studio,
bought this winter for two thousand pounds from Mr. Graham Robertson.
The story of this purchase was the only amusing thing we
ever heard Mr. Canfield say: "Offered the young fellow a thousand
pounds&mdash;wouldn't hear of it. Offered him two&mdash;jumped at it. Why,
the darned fool, if he had held on he could have had five!" Whistler
telegraphed for us to come and look at <i>Rosa Corder</i> for the last time in
England, "to make your <i>adieux</i> to her before her departure for
America." When E.&mdash;J. again away&mdash;arrived at the studio, he was
better than since his return from The Hague. He had slept eight
hours and a half the night before, and he rejoiced in not being
sleepy. He wiped the canvas here and there tenderly with a silk
handkerchief and kept turning round to ask triumphantly, "Isn't
she beautiful?"</p>

<p>Mr. Canfield was sitting again for his portrait, and was always
welcome, not merely as a sitter, but as a friend. He seemed to have
hypnotised Whistler, whom we heard say that Canfield was the only
man who had never made a mistake in the studio. We could not help
regretting this because of Canfield's notorious reputation in New York,
and the unpleasant things said of Whistler's tolerance of the man.
Whistler had been warned, but had sacrificed a friendship of years in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
his indignation at "a breath of scandal" against anyone whom he had
introduced to "the Ladies." In the early part of 1903 we received
numerous letters and telegrams from correspondents of American
papers in London re-echoing the question in the New York dailies,
"Is Whistler painting gambler Canfield?" The fact that Canfield
was much desired at home made the New York papers of the yellowest
sort, like the British respectable ones, eager for details, and all sorts and
conditions of male and female reporters haunted our stairs. They
were a terrible nuisance, and we remember in particular the youth who
came with the usual question, "Is Whistler painting the gambler?"
and who, on J.'s reply that he had better go and ask the painter, said
"But they tell me Whistler would either horsewhip me or kick me out
of the house. What do you think?" J.'s answer was that he had
better go and see. Whistler's condition rendered any remark which
might excite him dangerous, and everybody hesitated to suggest that
Canfield was a very public character to include in one's private circle.
Canfield's visits did not cease, and the fact that reconciled us to his
presence was that it resulted in one of Whistler's masterpieces. The
portrait, <i>His Reverence</i>, ranked then with <i>The Master Smith of Lyme
Regis</i>. But this was our estimate when we saw the picture in Whistler's
studio. Later it was simply ruined, for he worked on it too.</p>

<p>Whistler often saw dealers who came for his prints. On two
memorable afternoons Mr. David Kennedy brought the large
MacGeorge Collection of Whistler's etchings, which he had purchased
in Glasgow, for Whistler to look over, and, in some cases, we believe, to
sign them. He went through as many as he could, commenting on
their state and their preservation. There were some he had not seen
for years, and Mr. Ionides, who was present on one of the afternoons,
seemed to know more about them than Whistler. He soon tired, and
was not to be revived by the bottle of American cocktails which
Mr. Kennedy, to his complete approval, also brought. Several times
we found him going through the accumulation of "charming things"
from the studio in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. Many he did
not think so charming were, we understand, destroyed by him. So
Miss Birnie Philip maintains, and Mr. Lavery told us that he was
calling at Cheyne Walk one afternoon when Whistler said he had been
burning things. We are unable to state if a reliable list was made of
what was destroyed and what was kept. Some days Whistler read us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
parts of his earlier correspondence&mdash;the "wonderful letters" to the
Fine Art Society during the Venetian period. And once, tired though
he was, he insisted on reading to E. just once more his letter to a dealer,
who had threatened him with a writ and whom he warned of the
appearance he would make, "with one hand presenting a Sir Joshua
to the nation, with the other serving a writ on Whistler. Well indeed
is it that the right hand knows not always what the left hand doeth."</p>

<p>In November he sent the <i>Little Cardinal</i>, which had been at the
<i>Salon</i> the previous summer, to the Portrait Painters' Exhibition.
Several critics spoke of it as a work already seen, giving the impression,
he thought, that it dated back many years. He wrote to the <i>Standard</i>
to contradict this impression, Wedmore again having blundered. We
called to see him on the afternoon the letter was written, and he was in
great glee. He said:</p>

<p>"The letter is one of my best. I described Wedmore as Podsnap&mdash;an
inspiration, isn't it? With the discovery of Podsnap in art criticism
I almost feel the thump of Newton's apple on my head, and this I have
said. Heinemann promises to take it himself to the editor of the
<i>Standard</i>, and really the whole thing has such a flavour of intrigue that
I do believe it has made me well again!"</p>

<p>He planned to publish the criticism, his letter, the answers, and his
final comments in a brown-covered pamphlet, a scheme begun but,
owing to his feeble health, never carried out. To an exhibition of old
silver at the Fine Art Society's he lent many of his finest pieces and
insisted upon their being shown together in a case apart, and arranged
according to his instructions. His silver, like everything belonging to
him, was a proof of his exquisite taste and faultless judgment. It was
chosen, not for historic interest, nor for rarity, but for elegance of form
and simplicity of ornament. The other collections in the exhibition
were set out on red velvet; his, with which he sent some of his blue-and-white
china, was placed on his simple white table linen marked with
the Butterfly. After we had been to the exhibition, he asked us for
every detail:</p>

<p>"How did the white, the beautiful napkins look? Didn't the
slight hint of blue in the Japanese stand and the few perfect plates tell?
Didn't the other cases seem vulgar in comparison? and didn't the
simplicity of my silver, evidently for use and cared for, make the rest
look like museum specimens?"</p>

<p>He examined the catalogue, found fault with it because the
McNeill, of which he was so proud, was misspelt, and he could not
understand why there were comparatively fewer entries and shorter
descriptions of his case than of others where history supplied an
elaborate text.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his state, he forgot none of the old courtesies.
When, in November, Sir James Guthrie was elected to the Presidency
of the Royal Scottish Academy, he telegraphed his congratulations, and
was repaid by his pleasure when Guthrie, still a member of the Council
of the International, telegraphed back, "Warmest thanks, my President."
On New Year's Day (1903) we received the card of good
wishes it was his custom to send to his friends&mdash;a visiting-card with
greetings written by himself and signed with the Butterfly. Though
he could not go to the meetings of the International, the business done
at each had to be immediately reported, and when the annual dinner
was given he considered every detail, even to the point of revising the
<i>menu</i> and sending special directions for the salad. He had great
pleasure in the degree of LL.D. conferred upon him by Glasgow
University, at the suggestion of Sir James Guthrie and Professor
Walter Raleigh. Dr. D. S. MacColl, at their request, we believe, and
after consulting J., approached him first to make sure that the honour
would be accepted. There was a gleam of the old "wickedness"
when Dr. MacColl called. Whistler appointed a Sunday, asking him
to lunch, but when he arrived at the appointed hour he was sent
upstairs to the unused drawing-room and supplied with <i>Reynolds'</i>, a
Radical sheet adored by Whistler because of its wholesale abuse of the
"Islander." And Whistler said: "When at last he was summoned to
the studio, I told him it was the paper that of course he always wanted
to read at the Club, but was ashamed to be seen with! And all through
lunch I had nothing to say of art&mdash;I talked of nothing except West
Point."</p>

<p>However, when MacColl had a chance to explain why he came,
Whistler expressed his pleasure in receiving the degree. We recall his
pains with his letter of acknowledgment after the official announcement
came in March, his concern for the correct word and the well-turned
phrase, his anxiety that there should be no mistake in the Principal's
title and honorary initials. It illustrates his care for detail if we add
that, before writing the address, he sent a note, submitting it, next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
door, to Mr. and Mrs. Walton, who were Scotch, he said, and would
know. Another pleasure came from the deference shown him by the
Art Department of the Universal Exposition of 1904 at St. Louis. Early
in 1903 Professor Halsey C. Ives, Chief of the Art Department, was in
London, and went with J. to call on Whistler and to ask him to serve as
Chairman of the Committee, of which Sargent, Abbey, and J. were
members, for the selection of work by American artists in England. The
invitation was a formal recognition of Whistler's position, and he
accepted, though he did not live to occupy the post.</p>

<p>These months were not without worries. News of books about
him, in preparation or recently published, annoyed him, as he had
hoped to prevent such enterprises by giving us his authority for the
work to which his illness was a serious interruption. We called one
afternoon when he was worrying himself into a fever over the latest
attempt of which he had heard, and was unable to think or talk of
anything except the insolence of people who undertook to write about
him and prepare a biography without consulting him and his wishes.
As he talked he complained of pains in his back, and his restlessness
was distressing to see. Another afternoon, he was, on the contrary,
chuckling over Mr. Elbert Hubbard's <i>Whistler</i> in the <i>Little Journeys</i>
series. He read us passages:</p>

<p>"Really with this book I can be amused&mdash;I have to laugh. I don't
know how many people have taken my name in print, and, you know,
usually I am furious. But the intimate tone of this is something quite
new. What would my dear Mummy&mdash;don't you know, as you see her
with her folded hands at the Luxembourg&mdash;have said to this story
of my father's courtship? And our stay in Russia&mdash;our arrival in
London&mdash;why, the account of my mother and me coming to Chelsea
and finding lodgings makes you almost see us&mdash;wanderers&mdash;bundles
at the end of long sticks over our shoulders&mdash;arriving
footsore and weary at the hour of sunset. Amazing!&mdash;it would
be worth while, you know, to describe, not the book, but the effect
on me reading it."</p>

<p>He was looking desperately ill the day he told us that Montesquiou
had sold his portrait, and he was not consoled by the fact that Mr.
Canfield was the purchaser, so that it would remain, for the present
at least, in America. He was the more hurt because Montesquiou was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
a friend and, "as you know, the descendant of a long distinguished line
of French noblemen."</p>

<p>There were unnecessary worries. Mr. Freer sent some of Whistler's
pictures to the Winter Exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of
Fine Arts in Philadelphia. The jury awarded him the Academy's
Gold Medal of Honour, and, to assure to the pictures the place of
greatest distinction where they would look best, hung them before
anything was installed, building up a screen for them in the most
important room, and beginning the numbers in the catalogue with
them. For some reason Mr. Freer did not approve of the hanging and
seems to have misunderstood the motives for it. The secretary,
Mr. Harrison Morris, could make no change. As the incident was
reported to Whistler he fancied a slight in the arrangement which was
meant to do him honour. A similar incident occurred in the Spring
Exhibition of the Society of American Artists in New York, where, also,
Mr. Freer objected to the place chosen for Whistler's work. Whistler,
as a result, was disturbed by the idea that American artists were treating
him with indifference or contempt, though this was at the time when
their acceptance of him as master was complete and their eagerness to
proclaim it great. Whistler went so far as to say that he never
wished work of his to hang again in the Pennsylvania Academy, and in
regard to the New York Exhibition he wrote protesting to the New
York papers. The agitation and excitement did him no good, and in
his weakness such small worries were magnified into grave troubles. It
is the more to be regretted because, on all sides, in America he was
honoured. The fault was Mr. Freer's inability to understand artistic
matters. Mr. Will H. Low and other artists tried as well as they
could to explain things to Whistler, but Mr. Freer succeeded in prejudicing
him to the day of his death against the Pennsylvania
Academy, which had done more than any other American art institution
to show its appreciation. Americans may have been slow in
acknowledging him officially, but that was because they knew little of
his work. They began to make amends long before his death, and
their eagerness to possess his work may be contrasted to the indifference
in England or in Germany, where it is said a Whistler was bought for
Berlin by Dr. Bode for two thousand pounds, but was returned to the
dealers by the Emperor's command. The <i>Sarasate</i> had been purchased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
for the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in November 1896, the first
picture, Mr. Beattie, the Director, tells us, bought for the gallery, and
we believe the first Whistler bought for any American gallery. It is
prized as one of the most important works in the collection, and, though
it cost the Institute five thousand dollars, was insured for thirty thousand
when it went to the Rome Exhibition in the spring of 1911. We
were sorry when last in Pittsburgh to see that it is cracking. <i>The Yellow
Buskin</i> was in the Wilstach Collection, Philadelphia, and <i>The Master
Smith</i> and <i>The Little Rose of Lyme Regis</i> in the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts before 1903, and hardly an American collector of note was not
seeking to include Whistlers in his collection. Now the Chicago
Institute has <i>Southampton Water</i> and the Metropolitan in New York
has the <i>Irving</i>, <i>Connie Gilchrist</i>, <i>Cremorne Gardens</i>, and several important
studies, and has purchased from M. Duret his own large portrait
and been presented by Mr. E. G. Kennedy with his small one. M.
Duret parted with his because he felt he was growing old. He had had
many offers from private collectors, but he wished to know the painting
was safe in a museum. Two great masters had painted him, Manet
and Whistler, he said to us shortly after the sale, and both portraits are
now in public galleries. <i>The Fur Jacket</i> is at Worcester, and in the
Brooklyn Institute is the very unfinished and unsatisfactory commencement
of <i>Florence Leyland</i>. The <i>Lange Leizen</i> is in the Johnson Collection,
Philadelphia. The Avery collection of etchings is in the New
York Public Library, and Charles L. Freer has donated to the National
Gallery at Washington his entire collection, the largest in the world,
while we have given our collection of Whistleriana to the Library of
Congress; the best possible refutation to the nonsense talked about
want of appreciation by many self-styled critics, several of whom have
been imported into America and England since Whistler's death.</p>

<p>Whistler's health varied so during the winter that we were often
encouraged to hope. But with the spring hope lessened with every
visit. To consult our notes is to realise, more fully than at the time,
how surely the end was approaching. The afternoons of sleep increased
with the increasing weakness of his heart. He could not shake off the
influenza cold which was dragging him down, and he lived in constant
fear of infection from others if anybody even sneezed in his presence.
"I can't risk any more microbes&mdash;I've about enough of my own." At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
times his cough was so bad that he was afraid to talk, and he would
write what he wanted to say; it was his tonsils, he explained. There
were visits when, from the moment we came until we left, he worried,
first because the windows were open, then because they were shut, and
his impatience if the doctor's visit was delayed would have exhausted
a stronger man. J. dined with him on May 14, when there was a
rekindling of gaiety. He showed the portrait of Mr. Canfield; he
played dominoes for hours; at dinner, when a gooseberry tart was
served, he apologised for the "Island." But after this there was no
more gaiety for us to record. A few days later J. went abroad for several
weeks, and Mr. Heinemann sailed for America. When he said good-bye
to Whistler he was entrusted with innumerable commissions. He was
to find out the truth concerning the treatment of Whistler's pictures
in Philadelphia and New York, to discover who his new unauthorised
biographers were, what artists and literary people were saying, what
dealers were doing, and, when he returned, then they would "keep
house together again." This was the moment when Mr. Heinemann
took another flat, with the identical arrangements of the first, in
Whitehall Court, so that they could go back to the old life. But before
he returned the end had come.</p>

<p>Fortunately, while Mr. Heinemann and J. were away, Mr. Freer
arrived in London on his annual visit, and he was free to devote himself
to Whistler, whom he drove out whenever Whistler had the strength.
But this was not for long, and with her visit to him on July 1 E. gave
up hope. He was in bed, but hearing that she was there, he sent for
her. There was a vague look in his eyes, as if the old fires were burnt
out. He seemed in a stupor and spoke only twice with difficulty.
Miss Birnie Philip referred to his want of appetite and the turtle soup
ordered by the doctor, which they got from the correct place in the
City. "Shocking! shocking!" Whistler broke in slowly, and then
after a minute or two, "You know, now we are all in the City!"
Miss Birnie Philip wanted to give tea to E., who, seeing how ill he was,
thought it wiser not to stay, and after some ten minutes said good-bye.
"No wonder," Whistler murmured, "you go from a house where they
don't give you anything to eat." E.'s next visit was on the 6th. The
doctor had been with him, he was up, dressed, and had been out for a
drive. But he looked worse, his eyes vaguer, giving the impression of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
a man in a stupor. He said not a word until she was leaving, and then
his one remark was, "You are looking very nice."</p>

<p>Reports of his feebleness were brought to us by many, among others
by M. Duret. In July he came to London, and was deeply moved by
the condition in which he found Whistler, who, he thought, wanted to
say things when alone in the studio with him, but the day of his first
visit could not utter a word. And after a second visit, after an hour
with Whistler, who again struggled to talk and could not, Duret felt it
was the last time he would see Whistler. It was, and in his sorrow he
could but recall the days together gone for ever.</p>

<p>On the 14th E. called again, and again Whistler was dressed and in
the studio, and there were pictures on the easels. He seemed better,
though his face was sunken and in his eyes was that terrible vagueness.
Now he talked, and a touch of gallantry was in his greeting, "I wish I
felt as well as you look." He asked about Henley, the news of whose
death had come a day or two before. He watched the little mother
cat as she ran about the studio. There was a return of vigour in his
voice when Miss Birnie Philip brought him a cup of chicken broth and
he cried, "Take the damned thing away," and his old charm was in
the apology that followed, but, he said, if he ate every half-hour or so
as the doctor wanted, how could he be expected to have an appetite for
dinner? He dozed a little, but woke up quickly with a show of interest
in everything, and when, on the arrival of Mr. Lavery, E. got up to go,
fearing that more than one visitor would tire him, he asked, "But why
do you go so soon?" and these were the last words he ever spoke to her.</p>

<p>When J. returned to town, on Friday the 17th, he immediately
started for Chelsea, but met Mr. T. R. Way, who had been lunching
with Mr. Freer at the Carlton, and from whom he learnt that Whistler
and Mr. Freer were to go for a drive.</p>

<p>There was no drive that afternoon&mdash;no drive ever again. The
illness had been long, the end was swift. Whistler was dying before
Mr. Freer reached the house. On Thursday he had seemed much
better, had gone for a drive, and was so well at dinner that Mrs. Whibley
told him laughingly he would soon again be dressing to dine. But
after lunch on Friday she was called hurriedly to the studio, where
Miss Birnie Philip was already. They realised the seriousness of the
attack. The doctor was sent for, but the need for him had passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>The papers during the next few days showed how Whistler's fame
had grown. We saw another side which the public could not see&mdash;the
affection in which he was held by those who knew him intimately. Many
came to us at once: M. Duret, who had lost the last of his old comrades&mdash;first
Manet, then Zola, and now Whistler, with whom the best
hours of his life were spent; Mr. Kennedy, whose business relations
with Whistler had developed into warm friendship; Sir John Lavery,
Professor Sauter, Mr. Harry Wilson, their one thought to express their
love and reverence for their President. Other artists followed, others
wrote, and our sorrow for the friend was tempered by knowing how
deep and widespread was the regret for the master. Mr. Heinemann
returned from New York too late to see Whistler again, and both he
and J. were spared the sad memory of Whistler with the life faded
from his face, the light gone from his eyes.</p>

<p>The funeral took place on Wednesday, July 22. The service was
held in old Chelsea Church, to which he had so often walked with his
mother from Lindsey Row. There was a comparatively small attendance.
The members of his own family who came were his sister-in-law,
Mrs. William Whistler, and his nieces, Mrs. Thynne and Mrs. Réveillon.
The Society with which, in his last years, he had identified his interests
was represented by the Council: Professor Sauter, Mr. Harry Wilson,
Mr. Francis Howard, Mr. Ludovici, Mr. Stirling Lee, Mr. Neven
du Mont, Mr. E. A. Walton, and J. Here and there were friends,
Mr. Alan S. Cole, Mr. Heinemann, Mrs. Edwin A. Abbey, Dr. Chalmers
Mitchell, Mr. W. C. Alexander, Mr. Clifford Addams, Mr. Jonathan
Sturgis; and here and there Academicians, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema
and Sir Alfred East. But Whistler, who valued official recognition,
was given none. No one from the American Embassy paid the last
tribute of respect to the most distinguished American citizen who ever
lived in London. No one from the French Embassy attended the
funeral of the Officer of the Legion of Honour. No one from the
German Embassy joined in the last rites of the member of two
German Royal Academies and the Knight of the Order of St.
Michael of Bavarit. Nor was anyone present from the Italian
Embassy, though Whistler was Commander of the Crown of Italy
and member of the Academy of St. Luke. The only body
officially represented besides the International was the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
Scottish Academy. The police came to restrain the crowd, but
there was no crowd.</p>

<p>The coffin was carried the short distance from the house to the
church along the shores of the river he made his own. It was covered
with a purple pall, upon which lay a wreath of gold laurel leaves sent
by his Society. The pall-bearers were M. Théodore Duret, Sir James
Guthrie, Sir John Lavery, Edwin A. Abbey, George Vanderbilt, and
Mr. Charles L. Freer. The little funeral procession that walked with
the coffin from the house to the church included Miss Birnie Philip,
Mrs. Charles Whibley, their sisters, brother, and nephews, Mr. William
Webb, and Arthur Studd, but none of his own family, none of the
group with whom he had been most intimate in his last years. After
the burial service was read, the procession re-formed, and the family,
the Council of the International, and a few friends went to the graveyard
at Chiswick. It was a grey, stormy summer day, and as the
clergyman said the last prayers, and the coffin was lowered, the thick
London atmosphere wrapped the green enclosure in the magic and
mystery that Whistler was the first to see and to reveal. The grave
was made by the side of his wife under a wall covered with clematis.
A tomb designed by his stepson, E. Godwin, now covers the little
plot of ground where Whistler, the greatest artist and most striking
personality of the nineteenth century, lies at rest in a remote corner
of the London he loved, not far from the house, and nearer the grave,
of Hogarth, who had been to him the greatest English master from
the days of his boyhood in St. Petersburg.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<div class="gaptop2"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Page</span> 291, line 29.&mdash;"When you ask me to say something about the
illustrious and lamented Whistler, you do not, of course, want me to
add my contribution to the rich pyramid of admiration and praise
that has already been raised to his glory.</p>

<p>"What you must, of course, be thinking of, is anything special and
picturesque that I may be able to add to your biography of the great
artist.</p>

<p>"Well as I knew and loved his works, I had but a passing glimpse
of his person.</p>

<p>"Here are two interesting traits connected with it.</p>

<p>"Some few years ago, he was very much disturbed about a piracy
committed in Belgium by a foreigner living at Antwerp, of his curious
book, <i>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</i>. One day he appeared in my
study, and said to me with a sarcastic smile: 'I should like you to be
my counsel in this little affair, because I have been told that you, like
myself, practice the gentle art of making enemies.'</p>

<p>"The case was won at Antwerp with the collaboration of my
<i>confrère</i>, M. Maeterlinck, a relative of the poet who is such an honour
to our country. The victory was celebrated at his house. When
Whistler, the hero of the festivity, arrived at this hospitable abode, he
was a long time in the ante-room. The maid who had let him in came,
very much amazed, to the drawing-room where we were awaiting him,
and said in Flemish: 'Madame, there is an actor in the ante-room; he
is doing his hair before the looking-glass, he is putting on pomade,
painting and powdering his face.' After a long interval, Whistler
appeared, courteous, correct, waxed and anointed, resplendent as the
butterfly which his name recalls, and with which he signed some of the
notes he used to write to his counsel.</p>

<p>"This is all I can offer you.</p>

<p>"I have asked M. Maeterlinck for any documents connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
this episode he might have. All his researches have been in vain.
Although so many insignificant papers have been preserved, Fate the
perverse has allowed these precious fragments to disappear."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Page 415, line 6.&mdash;"Whistler was a painter whose drawing had
great depth, and this was prepared for by good studies, for he must
have studied assiduously.</p>

<p>"His feeling for form was not only that of a good painter, it was
that of a sculptor. He had an extraordinary delicacy of sentiment,
which made some people think that his basis was not very strong,
whereas it was, on the contrary, both strong and firm.</p>

<p>"He understood atmosphere most admirably, and one of his pictures
which made a very deep impression on me, <i>The Thames at Chelsea</i>, is a
marvel of depth and space. The landscape in itself is nothing; there
is merely this great extent of atmosphere, rendered with consummate
art.</p>

<p>"Whistler's art will lose nothing by the lapse of time; it will gain;
for one of its qualities is energy, another is delicacy; but the greatest
of all is its mastery of drawing."</p>
